hobbema 47 the angelus millet 58 april may and june sheep in spring and sheep mauve 68 in autumn review of pictures and artists studied the suggestions to teachers 78 the preface art supervisors in the public schools assign picturestudy work in each grade recommending the study of certain pictures by wellknown masters as supervisor of drawing i found that the children enjoyed this work but that the teachers felt incompetent to conduct the lessons as they lacked time to look up the subject and to gather adequate material recourse to a great many books was necessary and often while much information could usually be found about the artist very little was available about his pictures hence i began collecting information about the pictures and preparing the lessons for the teachers just as i would give them myself to pupils of their grade my plan does not include many pictures during the year as this is to be only a part of the art work and is not intended to take the place of drawing the lessons in this grade may be used for the usual drawing period of from twenty to thirty minutes and have been successfully given in that time however the most satisfactory way of using the books is as supplementary readers thus permitting each child to study the pictures and read the stories himself flora l carpenter stories pictures tell illustration sir galahad questions to arouse interest who is this man how is he dressed what do his armor and title sir tell us he is how many have read tennysons poems telling the story of the knights of the round table what does sir galahad look as if he were about to do why do you think he is starting on a journey rather than returning from one why do you think it must be an important journey how will he go what was expected of a knight in those days tell of some of their good deeds what would you judge the character of this knight to be where is he represented in this picture is he walking or standing still looking at something in particular or lost in thought does he appear angry meek determined hesitating thoughtful or dreamy what do his clasped hands indicate what color is the horse upon what part of the man and horse does the light fall what would you consider the main thought expressed in this picture original picture collection alexander henderson mp london england artist george frederick watts wŏts birthplace london england dates born 1817 died 1904 the story of the picture many wonderful stories have been told of the famous knights of the middle ages but none perhaps more interesting than the adventures of the knight sir galahad when he went in search of the holy grail in those times the greatest praise a boy could hope to receive was you are brave enough to become a knight some day or you are as courteous as a knight and his greatest ambition was to receive this title as he knelt before his sovereign or a superior knight in those days boys were carefully trained for knighthood just as for any other profession they were sent away from home when very young and spent at least ten years under severe discipline and training the boy galahad had passed through these years of preparation he had been taught to be quick in action—managing a horse so that he could jump on or off while it was in full gallop—to throw his spear with sure aim to run swiftly to obey all commands promptly and more difficult still he had learned to wait patiently and uncomplainingly when he could not understand why he should wait now he was twentyone years old knighthood had been bestowed upon him according to the custom by a blow with the flat of the sword on his shoulder as he knelt and the words arise sir galahad and now he was ready to start out on his quest for the holy grail the holy grail was the cup from which christ drank at the last supper it was bought from pilate by joseph of arimathæa and placed in a castle where it was guarded night and day it was passed on to josephs children who received the charge in sacred trust continuing to guard it faithfully the cup itself was most mysterious and wonderful it could be seen only by those who were perfectly pure in word thought and deed if an evil person came near it would seem to be borne away completely disappearing from view the sight of it was as food and new life to the one to whom it was revealed and hence would enable him to live forever make him very wise and of course preserve him from death in battle but there was one thing it did not do—it did not take away temptation to sin no matter how perfect the knight he could still be tempted he must continue to resist evil as long as he lived after a time the holy grail was left in the care of a king named amfortas who weakly yielding to an evil enchantment was severely punished not only was the sight of the grail denied him but a spell was cast upon him and all his court so that they lived in a sort of trance neither sleeping nor waking thus they must remain and suffer until a knight should come pure in body and soul who should break the spell and set them free many a young man began to plan the quest of the grail he must so live that by his good thoughts and deeds he might reach the enchanted castle see the holy grail and so set free the unhappy knights he must be perfect indeed if he would achieve this and full of courage perseverance and patience in our picture we see sir galahad all ready to mount his snowwhite horse and start out on his search for the holy grail he is in full armor his coat of mail which all knights wore was proof against any opponent of the time except one equally armed and armored it is said that a party of knights could ride unharmed through a host of common soldiers the horses too were protected but if the knight were once unhorsed and thrown upon his back he was so weighed down by the stiff and heavy armor that he could not rise again without help the knights weapons consisted of the lance the twohanded sword and a short sharp dagger sir galahad had secured his sword and shield in a most mysterious way the sword had been discovered protruding from the side of a wonderful rock of red marble jutting out from the surface of a river this wonderful sword no one had been able to draw out of the rock but when sir galahad tried the sword came out without the slightest difficulty and when he placed it in his empty scabbard it fitted there exactly the shield had been found by sir galahad in an old church where it had been left for him by an ancestor and where it had remained undiscovered for those many years then too when sir galahad came to the round table of king arthur and his knights in camelot he found them in the midst of a solemn meeting launcelot had just declared that according to prophecy a knight should come that very day who should occupy the siege perilous the siege perilous was a chair over which the magician merlin had cast a spell only a stainless knight could sit in it without danger of instant death as sir galahad entered the room he was preceded by a strange old man whom none had ever seen before then the doors and windows quietly and mysteriously closed of their own accord and the room was filled with a strange light these words in letters of fire appeared over the chair this is galahads seat by all these mysterious happenings the knights knew that sir galahad would be successful in finding the grail and many accompanied him on his quest sir galahad met with many adventures on his quest for the grail and in all of them came out victorious at length he reached the castle of the grail and here he met his first defeat entering the castle he gazed silently about him at the feeble old king and at the wretched company whom he had come to free from their living death before him passed the vision of the grail which he alone of all that company was permitted to see but it was not enough to see all this he was expected to ask the meaning of what he saw and by his question remove the enchantment but overconfident in his own knowledge he tried to solve the mystery without asking and so was forced to depart without success here at the very moment he was about to succeed he was found to be possessed of the one fault overconfidence lacking in that humbleness which seeks constantly for higher knowledge because of his failure to ask the necessary question the enchanted company had to continue to suffer his personal purity alone was not enough wisdom was necessary attainable not through himself alone but from the experience and understanding of others as he left the castle grounds the drawbridge closed with a crash there was a great sound of groaning and of voices reproaching him for having failed in his quest and the castle disappeared from his sight much discouraged he sought it again through many years until at last he found it once more and this time a much wiser man he asked the vital question broke the wicked spell and eventually found the holy grail tennyson has given us the story in verse in his holy grail this picture is one we often see in homes as well as in schoolhouses and in many public buildings it stands for the search for higher ideals which we are all making and so its appeal is universal the earnest uplifted face of the knight is full of youth and beauty the horse with his great intelligent eyes seems to know the importance of his errand the light comes from before them brightening the pathway as if it would lead them on and on through the tangle of vines and deep woods which opposes them if you have been fortunate enough to see a suit of armor in some museum you know how the heavy steel coat is planned and how the helmet which sir galahad has taken off will protect his head and face it is a moment of deep meditation and prayerful thought for sir galahad is about to start out upon an undertaking in which many have failed and in which he cannot be sure of success there is much of humility in his expression nothing of the proud dashing air of the adventurer this earnest thoughtful youth starting out full of courage and determination will always have time for the little courtesies of life for they are a part of his creed a true knight he has been taught should defend to the uttermost the oppressed aid the weak and be brave courteous chaste temperate generous and pious questions to help the pupil understand the picture who was sir galahad upon what quest is he about to start what preparation has he made for it how old is he now how did he receive the title sir what was the holy grail what power had this cup what could it not do for the person who saw it why was the sight of the grail denied to king amfortas what other punishment did he receive who could break this spell how what did sir galahad hope to do how is he dressed what protection was this armor what might happen if he should be unhorsed what weapons did he carry how had sir galahad secured his sword and shield tell about the round table of king arthur and the siege perilous what happened when sir galahad entered of what did all these mysteries persuade the other knights what happened when sir galahad came to the castle of the grail why did he fail what was the result of this defeat when did he succeed what was the result what is the main thought expressed in this picture the story of the artist george frederick watts was born and raised in london england he learned to draw we are told much in the same way he learned to talk his parents encouraged him always and he seems to have had very few obstacles to overcome though watts entered the royal academy school of painting at an early age he did not study there long his art education was thus gained largely by his own efforts and observation he studied ancient greek sculpture closely and his work was always influenced by the classical standard watts lived in an age when the spirit of reform was uppermost and men were preaching thinking and living it no wonder then his work is full of thoughtful purpose urging us on to the best that is in us he said i want to teach people to live to teach something higher than money making or mere pleasure getting to suggest great thoughts he did not paint as many others had for the mere pleasure of it or even from inspiration but rather for some definite purpose in the tate gallery at london is a great collection of the paintings which give the artists message to the world in 1843 the royal commission appointed for the decoration of the new houses of parliament awarded one of the prizes to watts for his fresco design this enabled him to study in italy for three years there he gained much in the richness of his coloring and ease in brushwork of his paintings for the government the first naval victory of the english and st george overcomes the dragon are perhaps the best known other famous pictures by watts are entitled ganymede orpheus and eurydice and psyche in 1867 watts became a member of the royal academy he worked very hard producing a great many paintings with noble generosity he donated a large number of pictures to his country particularly portraits of famous men among them lord tennyson robert browning swinburne dante gabriel rossetti burnejones and william morris the last few years of his life were devoted principally to portrait painting when tennyson was writing elaine he asked watts to tell him his idea of a good portrait and afterwards wrote this description from the answer as when a painter gazing on a face divinely thro all hindrance finds the man behind it and so paints him that his face the shape and color of a mind and life lives for his children ever at his best questions about the artist who was the artist and where was he born what help did he have in realizing his ambition to become an artist what was his aim in painting pictures give in your own words mr wattss idea of what a good portrait should be what helped him to go to italy what benefit did he get from his study in italy name some great men whose portraits watts painted a reading from homer questions to arouse interest what nationality is represented in this picture why do you think so to what are they listening what do their expressions indicate their feelings to be what musical instruments do you see in the picture from the picture would you say that the people are outdoors or indoors why artist sir lawrence almatadema ăl´mätăd´ēmȧ birthplace dronrijp the netherlands dates born 1836 died 1912 the story of the picture let us imagine ourselves in that great walledin city of athens at the time of its greatest prosperity fourth century bc at whatever gate we enter—and there are many of them—our attention will be drawn toward the high steep hill called the acropolis around which the city is built we may reach the top of this hill in a chariot driven over a road of marble or climb the marble steps entering the magnificent gateway where we find many beautiful statues temples and altars from this height we obtain a fine view of the city the sea other small hills temples and flatroofed houses as we look about us we are surprised at the absence of spires or towers there are no high towers or tall buildings most of the houses we see are onestory the reason for this it is said is the frequency of earthquakes the exterior of the houses is very plain they are built of common stone brick or wood coated with plaster and so close to the street that if the door opens outward the owner is compelled to knock before opening it in order to avoid injuring the passerby in the street there are no windows on the lower floor at the front of the house beside the door is a statue of hermes god of highways doorways and boundaries and the bringer of good luck or an altar to apollo god of light and the sun and the protector from all evil and over the door we may notice an inscription such as to the good genius followed by the name of the master of the house we raise the handle of the great knocker and scarcely has the sound echoed back to us when the door is opened by the porter we must be careful to step in with our right foot first as it is considered unlucky to cross the threshold with the left foot a long corridor or hall leads us to the open court where all is as beautiful as the exterior is plain usually a fountain and flowers brighten the marble court while on each side of it are the banqueting music sitting and sleeping rooms picture galleries and libraries but the greeks spent so much time out of doors that a house was to them only a safe place for their families and their property—a shelter from storm most of the houses had porticoes or porches and often the second story consisted of nothing but these porches around the open court the flat tiled roofs were used as promenades probably the greeks in our picture are seated on one of these porches or they may be in one of the summer pavilions which so many wealthy greeks had erected in their yards or grassy plots back of the house here they spent their afternoons and were entertained with music or by the tales of wandering minstrels or readers the scene in the picture is represented as if it were in the open air the column and stone wall behind the reader suggest a part of a house in the distance we catch a glimpse of the blue sea the slightly raised seat of the reader indicates that it is a place built expressly for this purpose before the greeks wrote their stories it was the custom of certain bards or readers to go about from place to place singing or reciting the stories of events which have made their national history even when the stories were written these bards were in great favor for the greeks preferred to hear the music of verse recited and to feel the thrill of enthusiasm which could be aroused by the human voice and not by a lifeless tablet or book the swaying form of the reader his rapt expression his flashing eye his musical voice rising and falling like the sea—these were the result of inspiration and had power to arouse men to noble actions in our picture we see such a reader giving an interpretation or reading much as our best elocutionists do now in his hand he holds a long scroll from which he reads the greeks used the egyptian papyrus and later the more expensive but finer parchment to write upon the reed pen was used and double inkstands for black and red ink which could be fastened to the belts or girdles of the writers in libraries the scrolls were arranged on shelves with the ends outward or in pigeon holes the reader unrolled one end of the scroll with one hand while with the other he rolled up the part he had read of all the greek stories none were more fascinating than those of the immortal homer according to tradition homer was a schoolmaster who growing tired of teaching began to travel wandering about from place to place he finally became blind after this great affliction came upon him he returned to his native town where he dictated his two great poems the iliad and the odyssey afterwards he wandered about from town to town singing them and adding to them as inspiration came it is not even known where he was born but according to an old greek epigram seven rival towns contend for homer dead through which the living homer begged his bread he was a beggar and yet he was a welcome guest at every home for he could play upon his fourstringed harp and sing of the wonderful deeds of the greek gods and heroes the subject of homers iliad is the story of the siege of troy in a contest between aphrodite venus and two other goddesses aphrodite the goddess of love and beauty had promised paris son of the king of troy that if he would declare her the most beautiful of the goddesses he should have for his wife the handsomest woman of his time helen wife of the king of sparta paris granted her request and going to sparta with aphrodites aid he carried off helen to troy of course her husband the king of sparta objected he appealed to all the grecian princes to help him and soon a hundred thousand men sailed away in eleven hundred and eightysix ships across the ægean sea and camped before the walls of troy the siege lasted ten years troy was finally taken by stratagem the greeks pretended to abandon the siege leaving behind them a great wooden horse as an offering to athena minerva goddess of wisdom and the special defender of citadels the trojans could not find out their reason for building the monster but while they were talking about it and gazing at it some shepherds brought into the town a young greek named sinon whom they had captured he told a pitiful story he said the greek leader hated him and had induced the greek soothsayer to declare that he must be put to death as a sacrifice for their safe return to greece he had escaped and hidden in a swamp until the greeks had gone the trojans were ready to be kind to any man whom the greeks hated and he was set free at once but tell us said the king why that monster of a horse was built sinon declared it was a sacrifice to athena because she was angry with them he said it was made too large to pass through your gates for they knew that if it was once within your walls it would protect you and victory would come to you instead of to the greeks the trojans believed every word of this and ordered the huge horse brought within their city even though they were obliged to take down part of the wall in order to make the opening large enough that night the treacherous sinon opened a door in the body of the horse and let out the armed greeks who were hidden inside they quietly slipped to the ground by means of a rope killed the watchmen and opened the gates to the greek army which had returned and was waiting outside a terrible battle followed in which nearly all the trojans were killed helen was taken back to greece in homers odyssey he tells the adventures of ulysses king of ithaca during the return journey from troy ulysses had been one of the bravest of the greek leaders and was one of the heroes concealed in the wooden horse the poem is full of vivid description and noble sentiments both pathetic and sublime and it stirred the hearts of the greeks with pride and joy it is easy to see the interest in the faces of the listeners in the picture partly robed in a rosecolored garment the reader sits on a chair of marble holding on his knees a roll of papyrus from which he is reading to a group of four persons before him a wreath of bay leaves crowns his head and as he leans forward his face expresses enthusiasm while he tells the thrilling adventures of the hero of homers story in the center of the background we see a woman on her hair is a crown of daffodils and in her left hand something resembling a tambourine she half sits half reclines on a marble bench a resting place which the greeks always preferred to chairs on the floor near her in an attitude of careless ease sits a young man who is very likely her lover since he is holding her hand his face expresses his interest in the story in his right hand he holds a lyre which suggests that the company has been listening to music and that they will enjoy it again after this recital how intent their faces are as they follow in imagination all the adventures of their sturdy ancestors near the center of the picture and stretched out gracefully on the marble floor is a youth who appears anxious not to lose one word of the story at the left we see a man standing he wears a crown of flowers on his head and wraps his long cloak closely about him his face is wild and sad his appearance seems to tell that he has duties elsewhere and ought to leave but is being held by the story the people are all dressed in typical greek costumes the dress of greek men and women was very much alike when they appeared on the streets they wore a cloak which consisted of a large square piece of cloth so wrapped about them as to leave only the right arm free it required much skill to drape it gracefully and the manner in which this was done decided the taste and elegance of the wearer the women and men of the higher classes wore what they called a chiton or dress which consisted of two short pieces of cloth sewed or clasped together and fastened over the shoulder leaving open spaces for the arms it was fastened at the waist with a girdle a man usually wore this chiton although he was considered fully dressed in the cloak alone it was the lower classes who wore the tanned skins so the young man lying on the floor is probably a servant a touch of bright color is added to this picture by the flowers in the girls hair and those scattered on the bench beside her the flesh painting in this picture is claimed to be the most perfect that almatadema ever did and the painting of the girl and her lover one of his highest efforts the reader is the center of interest in the picture the light the lines and the position of the figures make this apparent the painting of these five large figures occupied the artist only eight weeks but the preliminary studies before he began painting took eight months almatadema excelled in his painting of marble and this picture gave him every opportunity to display his genius since nearly the entire background is of marble the delicate colors of the young girls costume with the few bright touches of color in the flowers the darker richer colors of the mens cloaks and back of it all the clear opalescent colors of marble and the deep blue of the sea beyond give the picture a distinctive beauty which is most pleasing to the eye a close student of greek history almatadema has been particular to see that every little detail is in harmony and consistent with the age and country questions to help the pupil understand the picture what is the center of interest in this picture what lines in the picture direct your eye to the reader how does the light do this the position of the figures tell something of greek life of homer of the siege of troy why did it take the artist eight months to get ready to paint this picture to the teacher each pupil may be asked to draw one greek ornament from some history encyclopedia or dictionary subjects for compositions a day in a greek home a greek library homer and his writings a description of a reading from homer the artist the story of the artist sir lawrence almatadema of dutch parentage was born in the little village of dronrijp near leewarden the netherlands in the year 1836 when he was very young his father died leaving his mother with a large family and small means and it was decided from the first that almatadema must learn a good trade or profession his progress at school caused his mother much anxiety for the boy cared for nothing except roman history which he began to study by himself having secured some quaint old coins in the neighborhood he spent much of his time copying the heads of the emperors on the coins he soon began to show remarkable talent for painting a portrait which he painted of his sister was exhibited when he was only fifteen years old but his mother wished him to become a lawyer because she felt it would bring the best financial returns he tried to please her but a serious illness was the result when the doctor advised the mother to let him become an artist she gave her consent and it is said the boy recovered with astonishing rapidity he studied at antwerp many years winning such success that he sent for his mother and sister to come to live with him then he began to make a special study of egypt greece and rome after his marriage to an english lady he moved to london where he lived the rest of his life his love for marble and the polished surfaces of bronze gold and other metals is clearly shown in most of his pictures even his portraits usually represent the sitter as glancing in a mirror or in some way reflected in it perhaps no other artist has ever made so much use of flowers in his pictures the flowers seem to add the one touch of bright color which beautifies the whole picture almatadema gives us a clear understanding of the home life of the greeks and romans and so has become known as the painter of the ancients almatadema became a british subject in 1873 his home in st johns wood in the northwest part of london is described as a most interesting place the first glimpse of it seen through the trees shows the gilded weather vane in the form of a palette later the stone pillars of the roman porch in all its details the house is carefully and beautifully furnished the brass knocker on the door the entrance into a sort of sun parlor paved with tiles and bright with beautiful flowers and the sound of a fountain near at hand a flight of marble steps leads to a hall in which beautiful painted panels the gifts of friends are the chief decoration great tiger skins cover the floor mrs tadema also is an artist and has her studio on this floor in her studio and the living rooms she has given full sway to her own fancy for the sixteenthcentury old dutch most of their contents having been brought from the netherlands almatademas taste is purely classical and his studio is consistent in all respects—marble pillars carved woodwork chairs and cushions here he lived and worked with this motto before him as the sun colours flowers so art colours life questions about the artist of what nationality was the artist why was his mother so anxious to have him learn a trade or profession what did he like to study what picture did he exhibit when he was fifteen years old what prevented his becoming a lawyer what countries did he prefer to represent what materials did he excel in painting for what has he become famous illustration the golden stairs the golden stairs questions to arouse interest what does this picture represent what is there unusual about this stairway why do you suppose burnejones painted the stairs without a railing what is there unusual about these figures what are they carrying in their hands where are they going where did they come from do they seem to be standing still or moving what makes you think so are they noisy or quiet in their movements why do you think so why has the leader raised her hand what can you see in the window above the stairs is this a sad or a happy procession why do you think so what do you like best about this picture original picture private collection of lord battersea england artist sir edward burnejones bûrnjōnz birthplace birmingham england dates born 1833 died 1898 the story of the picture the artist burnejones was a student and a dreamer as a small motherless boy he had been left much alone in a home in which storybooks were considered wicked so there were none for him to read his father was a strong churchman and intended his son for the ministry he was endeavoring as best he knew how to fit him for his high calling by a training which though perfectly sincere and honest in purpose was rather gloomy and severe for the delicate sensitive boy however little edward was naturally of an imaginative mind so he made up his own stories a relative sent him a copy of æsops fables and this book he was permitted to keep it seems to have brought the turning point in the boys life from that time on he dwelt in a fairyland of his own making when he was sent away to school to prepare for the ministry he carried his fancies with him adding to them the many legends of greek mythology of literature especially those wonderful stories of king arthurs court and of the bible his desire to become an artist was aroused by another student william morris the two spending all their spare time drawing and painting nevertheless he was twentythree years old before he saw any of the great masterpieces in painting from the very first burnejones chose subjects which were mysterious fairylike and unreal but his pictures were so filled with music beauty and happiness that it was a delight to look at them his idea of a good picture was very different from that of the practical painstaking millet who represented everything and everybody as they actually appeared before him in the very field or place he had found them burnejones tells us i mean by a picture a beautiful romantic dream of something that never was never will be in a light better than any light that has ever shone in a land no one can define or remember only dream and so when asked to paint a decoration for a hallway in one of the fine old london homes he thought at once of a stairway and the painting of the golden stairs is the result it would seem indeed a dream this angel host descending from we know not where and halting at that mysterious closed door which leads we know not whither but hush the leader has half raised her hand turning this way as if to ask for silence each figure stops instantly holding herself motionless while the musical instruments are slightly lowered that all may listen more intently and yet this is a joyous procession—the gayly colored wreaths of flowers which most of them are wearing the musical instruments the happy faces all tell us this is an errand of pleasure might it not be that this host of angels is descending upon the sleeping world to soothe the restless worried ones and smooth the puckered aching brows in quiet slumber lulled by their gentle music or the rustle of their approaching footsteps the weary one would soon find refreshing sleep the light in the picture seems to come from above yet is all about and around the figures as if they were the source of the illumination they come from a darkened doorway and enter one quite as dark except for the light they bring to it the greater part of the picture is painted in shades of gray but it is relieved by the flesh tints and the gayly colored flowers worn in wreaths or scattered on the steps here is delicate exquisite coloring and figures drawn with such careful attention to details that each seems complete in itself yet all are held together in one great harmony it is interesting to draw an oblong of this same proportion and then represent the curved lines in this picture it makes us feel the movement swing and rhythm which come to us like approaching music the picture is full of idyllic charm which takes us away from all the prosaic details of everyday life to a fairyland where this happy throng may come and go with music flowers and delight the calm thoughtful faces so full of kindly purpose and high ideals cannot fail to inspire us with good thoughts the dove in the upper casement window is typical of the peace that pervades this scene the faint far from earthly shadows the bare feet even the stairway without a railing or protection of any kind all suggest that our youthful maidens are celestial beings their destination we can only guess perhaps that is why the picture has had several names the kings wedding music on the stairs and the one by which it is now known the golden stairs burnejones made many beautiful designs for stainedglass windows and we can but regret that he did not produce this picture in that way also questions to help the pupil understand the picture tell about the boyhood and early training of the artist what book influenced him most how did it affect his choice of subjects to paint how did he happen to become interested in art how old was he before he first saw a great painting compare the subjects chosen by burnejones and by millet as to character and feeling what was burnejoness idea of a good picture how did he happen to paint the golden stairs for what room was it intended what colors did the artist use in this painting in what ways does it suggest music how would you explain the destination of these maidens their errand from whence they come what would you consider the chief charm in the picture the story of the artist we have heard how the small burnejones was brought up by a rather strict but ambitious father and perhaps have felt sorry for the boy who used to spend hours before the windows of a book store gazing at the even rows of books with such wistful longing but we need not feel so for it was this very desire for books and stories that led him to use his own imaginative power when he was old enough to begin serious preparation for the ministry his father sent him to king edwards school here he earned a scholarship to oxford when he left home for oxford it seemed as if his real life had begun for it was here that he met friends who had the same tastes and longings as himself one friend in particular william morris shared with him his newfound delight in art both had intended to prepare for the ministry but now they decided to give up all else and pursue the study of art so at the age of twentythree burnejones left oxford and went to london where he began painting in earnest from the very first he showed great originality both in his subjects and in his manner of representation many of his subjects were taken from the bible from greek mythology or from stories of king arthurs court sometimes he painted with but the one idea of making something beautiful as in this picture of the golden stairs burnejones was fortunate in his first teacher rossetti who was a man so filled with the beauty of a scene that he must paint it for sheer joy in order to pay for this instruction burnejones made designs for stainedglass windows and became famous for the beauty of these windows the one at trinity church boston is called david instructing solomon in the building of the temple at oxford is the famous saint cecilia window he designed for christ church college it seems strange that burnejones should wait until he grew to manhood before he discovered that he had the desire and the ability to draw other artists tell of the years spent in longing and their constant struggle for the sake of their art but when burnejones made up his mind he spent no time in experiment or even practice he devoted all his time to the one idea which filled his thoughts he made no effort whatever to find out whether his work would meet with popular favor or not beginning at once with what he knew to be his right material the only difference to be noticed in his first and his last paintings was a difference in the speed and skill with which he handled the paints new ideas occurred to him so rapidly that he formed the habit of making quick sketches and putting them aside until he had time to work them out carefully burnejones had never rebelled against the profession his father chose for him indeed he felt satisfied and made every effort to succeed in it perhaps if he had remained at home or even if he had not met the enthusiastic william morris just when he did he might never have discovered his power as a painter the knowledge of the disappointment at home and the small means at his disposal did not hinder him from forsaking the profession his family had chosen for him for was he not following the advice of the great painter rossetti not many young artists have found such a friend as rossetti was to burnejones he not only gave the desired instruction but helped his pupil get such work as he was capable of doing when the glass makers applied to rossetti for a design for a stainedglass window he declined to undertake the work but recommended his pupil instead a visit to italy gave burnejones new inspiration later when william morris married and went to live in a house which had been built for him at bexley heath he had difficulty in furnishing this house to suit his taste and desire for beautiful things this led morris to establish a firm to make such things of course burnejones was heartily in sympathy with his friend and put his talents as a designer at the disposal of the firm his wonderful imagination and fine powers of expression produced all kinds of decorative work such as tapestries embroideries carved chests book covers book illustrations and decorations for pianos screens and friezes although he received so much praise in his later years at first he too had to pass through the fire of criticism and even ridicule at one time burnejones was ridiculed in the pages of punch while in another magazine he was spoken of as the greeneryyallery grosvenorgallery young man but these criticisms were soon forgotten and all england was proud to honor this artist with medals in 1894 burnejones was given the title of baronet questions about the artist tell about the boyhood of burnejones his education what kind of subjects did he choose for his paintings what was his idea of a good painting who was his first teacher why did he wait so long before he began to study painting what can you say of his imagination tell about william morris and his new home what did burnejones do for his friend illustation aurora aurora questions to arouse interest what goddess does this represent whom is she leading upon what do they rest over what are they passing what has aurora in her hands toward whom is she looking in what is apollo riding how many horses has he what has the cherub in his hand which way does the flame blow why what makes you think they are moving in what direction do their garments blow who painted this picture why do you like it original picture pavilion of the rospigliosi palace rome italy artist guido reni gwēdō rānē birthplace bologna italy dates born 1575 died 1642 the story of the picture imagine yourself in that farfamed city of rome driving through its white streets to the great quirinal palace to see the original of our picture the quirinal a very large and very ordinary looking building has been the scene of many interesting events and is always used as the meeting place for the cardinals who elect the pope our drive ends here but it is only the beginning of our journey after a delightful walk through a courtyard so completely surrounded by high stone walls that we should never have guessed its existence we come to another palace this palace is much more beautiful although not so large it is called the rospigliosi palace because it has always belonged to a family of that name then we pass on through a beautiful garden of magnolias until we reach the pavilion or casino of the palace where we find our picture there are several rooms in this pavilion but it is the middle room which holds our attention for it is up on the ceiling of this room that we see aurora goddess of the morning leading the way for the fiery steeds of apollo the sun god as we enter such a glow of color fills the room that we know instinctively this must be the place first we see aurora herself flying ahead scattering the clouds of night and showering roses and dewdrops over the sleeping earth she looks back toward apollo the sun god to see if he is following her on his journey around the heavens in his chariot of the sun the horses are restless and eager and it takes a steady hand to guide them some idea of the difficulties attending such a journey may be gained from the greek story of phaëthon according to this story apollo had a son named phaëthon one day the boy came to him complaining that the other boys made fun of him when he told them who his father was they said they did not believe that a boy who could do nothing at all could be the son of the mighty apollo this made the father very angry and when phaëthon asked him to let him do something that should prove to the world that he was apollos son apollo told the boy he would give him permission to do whatever he asked the boy quickly asked permission to drive the sun chariot for one day but this request alarmed apollo who said none but myself may drive the flaming car of day—not even jupiter whose terrible right arm drives the thunderbolts he urged his son to take back his request before it was too late warning him it would prove his destruction but the boy was only the more anxious to drive and held his father to his promise then apollo told phaëthon of the journey the first part of the way he said is so very steep that although the horses start out in the best possible condition they can hardly climb it the next part is so high up in the heavens that i dare not look down upon the earth and sea below lest i grow dizzy and fall the last part of the journey is the most difficult of all because the road descends rapidly and it is hard to guide the horses and all this time apollo went on the heavens are turning around and carrying the stars with them but even as he spoke aurora threw open the cloud curtains which hid the earth and there appeared the road upon which she cast her roses while beckoning to the eager boy hardly listening to his fathers anxious warnings phaëthon jumped into the golden chariot grasped the reins of the four fiery steeds and off they started at first he remembered what apollo had said and was careful but he soon grew reckless driving at full speed the horses knowing it was not their masters hand took the bits between their teeth and were soon out of his control for a time they followed the road but when that was lost they began to descend toward the earth so rapidly it seemed as if they would be dashed to pieces then up again they started in reckless dizzy flight at times they came so close to fields and woods as to scorch and blacken them other fields they did not pass and these were frostbitten then a great wail of complaint went up from the earth this cry was heard by jupiter the most powerful of the gods who looking earthward and discovering the cause of all this trouble was very angry with his terrible right arm he drove a thunderbolt at the reckless youth and in an instant phaëthon fell from the chariot headlong into the sea the horses finding themselves free returned to apollo and never since then has any hand but his been permitted to guide them the greeks declared that the great desert of sahara in africa is the place where the suns chariot scorched the earth and that it was then that the african negroes were burned black phaëthons boy friend who was constantly diving down into the water trying to recover his body was turned into a swan and phaëthons weeping sisters were changed into poplar trees in our picture we see apollo holding the reins accompanied by the hours and preceded by aurora and the cherub torchbearer or morning star they seem to be moving rapidly on their way borne up by the clouds the sky is a brilliant golden yellow and its fleecy clouds are tinged with purple the graceful figures of the hours are each represented in pale or brightercolored draperies according to the time of day to which they belong aurora herself is clothed in rainbow hues her draperies flying with her swift progress far below we see the land and sea wrapped in slumber awaiting the coming of the dawn questions to help the pupil understand the picture where is the original painting of the aurora what goddess does it represent what is the greek myth concerning her what part has apollo in this picture how many horses does he drive how are the hours represented what does the cherub carrying a torch represent in what direction does the flame of the torch blow why is apollos journey so difficult who was phaëthon what did he ask of apollo why did he wish to do this why was apollo alarmed tell about phaëthons journey and what happened to him upon what does the chariot seem to rest over what are they passing what colors did the artist use in this painting to the teacher subjects for compositions aurora goddess of the morning apollo the sun god the story of phaëthon apollos son the story of the artist guido reni was born in the little village of bologna italy as a small child he gave every promise of becoming an accomplished musician his father himself a gifted performer began to teach him to play the flute and harpsichord as soon as he was old enough to handle the instruments guido had a beautiful voice and the father hoped to make a fine musician of him but the boy also had a beautiful sunshiny face which attracted the attention of an artist who asked permission to paint him as an angel in several pictures after watching this artist at work guido began to wish to paint pictures too and was permitted to take a few lessons his first picture was a surprise to the artist causing him to urge guidos father to allow the boy to develop his talent about this time too guido began to make all kinds of interesting figures in clay and his fingers were always busy at thirteen years of age he so excelled the other pupils of the artist that he was allowed to teach some of them later guido went to rome where he remained for twenty years in great favor he then moved to bologna and there opened a large school for art students he made his home in bologna during the rest of his life guido reni might have lived all his life in splendor and ease for he earned great sums of money but as his fame grew he became more and more extravagant in his habits and so was always in debt he was obliged to paint hurriedly and to the utmost of his genius that he might have more pictures to sell however his keen sense of beauty did not desert him and his popularity continued to the end he was especially skillful in representing beautiful upraised faces of women and children one day a young nobleman met guido reni and asked him where he found such lovely models for his paintings he said the other artists were wondering about it and thought him very selfish to keep them to himself guido replied in a mysterious voice come to my studio signor and i will show you my beautiful model so filled with delight and eager anticipation the nobleman tiptoed after the artist up the stairs to the studio you can imagine how he must have felt when guido reni called his colorgrinder who has been described as a great greasy fellow with a brutal look and posed him as the colorgrinder sat quietly looking up through the skylight guido took a pencil and after sketching very rapidly for a few minutes showed his guest a sketch of a beautiful magdalen gazing upward then turning to his visitor he said earnestly dear count say to your ‘other artists that a beautiful idea must be in the imagination and in that case any model will serve guido reni had the greatest admiration for the paintings of raphael and went to rome just to study them as he loved to work with clay himself he spent much of his time in rome studying the beautiful pieces of statuary there he tells us that his favorites were the venus de medici and niobe pleasant and courteous to all he made friends everywhere and was greatly beloved once when he was very ill his friends hired musicians to play just outside his door this pleased him greatly as he was always passionately fond of music he said to them and what then will be the melodies of paradise guido reni was a great favorite of pope paul v and many of his pictures were painted for the pope when he returned from rome to bologna he found himself more popular than ever and quite overwhelmed with orders for pictures of all his paintings the aurora is generally considered his best the story is told of a little girl who had lived all her life in the country upon her first visit to her uncle in the city she discovered a large and splendid copy of the aurora in his living room one morning her uncle came into the room and found his little niece gazing at the picture in rapt admiration well mary he said what do you think of it oh uncle she replied i like it ‘cause they are in such a hurry so young and old have found one reason or another for liking this picture guido reni painted many portraits as well as many historical and mythological pictures some of the best known of guidos paintings are reclining venus with cupid st michael and the dragon beatrice cenci little bacchus drinking and the mater dolorosa of solimena questions about the artist where was the artist born what two talents had he how did he happen to study painting how did he succeed with his first picture

gallery london england artist meyndert hobbema hŏbĕ mä birthplace amsterdam the netherlands dates born 1638 died 1709 the story of the picture there is a little village in the netherlands by the name of middelharnis and if we should go there today we should find just such an avenue of trees as this one in our picture the artist hobbema spent many years in this village painting scenes in and around it probably he traveled over this very road countless times it would seem as if we too were walking down the road guarded by those tall slender trees which border each side of it they are poplar trees trimmed so high that we scarcely recognize them they lead direct to the little village beyond which we see between the tree trunks since the village is almost surrounded by the north sea its high church tower is not only picturesque by day but useful at night as a lighthouse or beacon to guide the sailor to a safe port in our picture the sun is half hidden in a sky as full of fleecy clouds as the sky near the north sea generally is we must expect no hills nor elevations of any kind in the netherlands a land lying lower than the ocean the great protecting dikes and the many canals extending in every direction make it one of the most interesting of countries in the picture we see on each side of the road a deep ditch full of water these ditches irrigate the land flowing into deeper wider canals on which sail boats of various sizes and kinds it is said that every true hollander can skate in the winter when these canals are frozen young and old go about upon their various errands on skates it is a common sight then to see women skating to market carrying upon their heads heavy baskets filled with rolls of butter cheese eggs or other provisions the children skate to school and men go about their business in this same pleasant way it is easy to reach all parts of the village or city by these canals for there are so many of them in some cities the people have no streets but use canals instead at the right of our picture we catch a glimpse of a thrifty wellkept nursery garden full of shrubs and fruit trees which the man is busily trimming he works contentedly for all about him he sees the evidences of prosperity and peace coming toward us along this straight and level road is a huntsman carrying his gun over his shoulder and preceded by his dog a path leads away from the road to the picturesque little cottage or farmhouse at the right two peasants a man and a woman stand in the path talking we do not doubt they will turn to greet our hunter for it is a friendly countryside where all are treated cordially we cannot see much on the extreme left of the picture except the trees which grow luxuriantly and a flat meadow land which reaches almost to the village it is a common everyday sort of landscape yet its charm seems to lie in this very fact we would know at once if the perspective were not correct for we have solved just such problems ourselves with the tree tops or perhaps telegraph poles and it gives us an added sense of pleasure to be able to understand just the problem hobbema had to solve as he placed his easel in the middle of the road and started to paint his great canvas the light is rather uncertain on this cloudy day the artist used little color except grays and a peculiar green which he delighted in using in all his paintings a touch of brighter color appears in the cheerful red of the roofs of his houses which suggest something of the homely comfort and cleanliness that may be found in most dutch homes the most striking characteristic of hobbemas painting is his severe combination of vertical and horizontal lines the positive vertical lines of the tree trunks standing so tall and straight against the wide expanse of sky are reëchoed in the shorter but equally slender trunks of the fruit trees in the nursery garden and of the trees at the side of the path leading to the farmhouse also in the two straight figures standing in the path and again in the church tower in the distance the horizontal lines are equally positive they separate the garden from the road they appear in the road itself and in the horizon line beyond if we make a sketch of the important lines in this picture we find them either vertical or horizontal and much more severe in outline than the usual diagonal or curving lines we have grown accustomed to looking for critics seem to vary as to the feeling with which this picture inspires them although all agree upon its value as a masterpiece some declare there is a sort of hopelessness in the landscape which suggests the unhappy life of the artist who often went hungry and whose paintings were not appreciated until after his death to them the scene is full of hopeless beauty suggesting all kinds of joys which are never realized yet continue just out of reach throughout a long and cheerless life so it is a sad beauty and gives one a feeling of desolation even in a land where all is prosperity other critics see only the thrifty contented life of the netherlands peasant who by his intelligence and labor has overcome even the sea itself and compelled it by means of dikes and canals to add to his safety and comfort we know how much hobbema must have loved his work for he received no return for it during his lifetime unless it was the joy of work and yet he persevered can we not imagine him on a pleasant day seated or standing at his easel in the middle of this road quite forgetting poverty and even hunger as he painted this beautiful landscape before him hobbema was certainly daring and full of courage when he attempted so severe and unusual a composition as this he has placed his road almost exactly in the center of the picture balancing the sides quite evenly yet he has not made it monotonous or tiresome the eye is constantly discovering new beauties in the landscape or the inclosing sky only a master could produce a work such as this questions to help the pupil understand the picture what country is represented in this picture what kind of trees are those bordering the road to what do they lead the eye of what use could the church tower in the distance be why is the netherlands such a level country what can you see on each side of the road of what use are the canals what is the man doing in the garden who else can you see in the picture what colors did the artist use how can you tell whether the perspective of the road is correct or not what can you say of the sky what can you say of the balance in the composition the kinds of lines what kind of a day is represented what do some of the critics say about this picture what is so unusual about this composition why do most artists avoid placing the center of interest in the middle of the picture why do you like this picture the story of the artist we know very little about the artist meyndert hobbema except that he was a hollander possessing so great a love for his native land that he continued to represent it on canvas in spite of the fact that his countrymen were quite indifferent to him and his work his pictures were disposed of somehow perhaps given away for when a hundred years after his death the world suddenly began to value them it was found that he had left enough canvases to have made him the wealthiest man in the country yet he died in the almshouse and was buried beside his wife in a paupers grave now all the netherlands would give him honor but so neglected was he during his life that it is impossible to find out even where he was born three cities claim this honor but it is generally conceded that he was born at amsterdam it is certain he was married and died there we determine the date of his birth by the date and his age as given in the record of his marriage hobbemas paintings were so real that the people who were used to more fanciful idealized pictures thought his commonplace and of no especial interest now they recognize the great sympathy with and insight into the very life of their country which hobbema possessed in rare measure he made it real to us too in his scenes of thrift and industry prosperity and smiling peace we are told that hobbema was a plain practical matteroffact man and his pictures make us think he must have been like him they are plain unassuming and natural free from artificial grace or fancy he did not hunt for scenes of unusual beauty with romantic or weird stories but chose some pleasing view near at hand and painted it just as it was sometimes he painted the same scene several times from exactly the same position if all his works could be placed in one gallery for exhibition we might find it rather monotonous to see so many just alike but although he did not have the inventive genius of burnejones or of many other artists his paintings were always true to nature he has been called the painter of the afternoon sun because he seemed so fond of the sunlight showing through the trees and casting long shadows across the fields many believe that hobbema must have been a pupil of ruysdaels because their work was so much alike we know that they lived in the same place at the same time and it is generally believed they were friends dealers often substituted the name of one for that of the other and later when corrections were attempted it was impossible to tell which was hobbemas work and which ruysdaels because both had painted the same subjects at one time hobbema was appointed gauger for the town it was his duty to measure the quantity of all liquids imported into holland this position must have paid a fairly good salary for hobbema was married directly after his appointment it must have taken all his time too for he painted very little for nearly twenty years the fact that he had a means of livelihood did not spur him on to greater efforts he painted only when he felt like it not very often and small unimportant pictures whether he lost this office before or after his wifes death is not known but for some reason or other his last years were spent in extreme poverty twentysix years after his death his pictures began to sell and soon picture dealers were scouring the country for his works his landscapes are not full of people animals or anything that might disturb the calm quiet restfulness of the scenes like ruysdael he too was compelled to call upon other artists to draw the few figures he did use as he found this part most difficult one thing we may be sure of when we look at his paintings and that is they were faithful representations of the place before him so we may know just how this road leading to the village of middelharnis really looked more than two centuries ago other famous paintings by hobbema are entitled showery weather village with water mills woody landscape ruins of brederode castle forest scene cottage in a wood and entrance to a wood questions about the artist what kind of a man do you think hobbema must have been why in what ways do his pictures resemble him what kind of pictures did he like to paint what time of day why might an exhibition of all his paintings prove monotonous what would you consider one of the best things about his paintings what other great artist lived at this time and in the same place how did their paintings resemble each other what office did hobbema hold what were some of his duties how did this position affect his work what became of his paintings why was he so poor why were his paintings not appreciated how are they regarded now why do you think hobbema must have loved his work illustration the angelus by permission of braun & co paris and new york the angelus questions to arouse interest in what attitude are these peasants standing what have they been doing with what have they been working what can you see in the background from what direction does the light come what time of day do you think it is in what country why have they stopped their work who of you can tell what the angelus is what feeling does this picture give you—one of sadness peace quiet noise prosperity poverty or happiness original picture collection chauchard paris artist jean françois millet mē´lĕ birthplace gruchy france dates born 1814 died 1875 the story of the picture although our print is only black and white we are made to feel the brightness of the sunset in this picture the horizon veiled in a haze shows the church tower of the distant village faintly silhouetted against the sky while the sinking sun casts its long shadows across the field but our eyes do not dwell long on sky church or field for the two figures draw our gaze the bright rays from the setting sun fall directly upon the woman who faces the west the man turning toward her is partly in shadow no doubt these two peasants have been working in the fields the man digging potatoes as we may judge by those in the basket and the two wellfilled bags on the wheelbarrow as he digs them the woman gathers them up in her basket and empties them into the sacks thus busily engaged they suddenly hear the church bell its great tone coming far across the field reminds them that it is the hour of prayer so putting down the pitchfork and basket they stand with bowed heads as they repeat the evening prayer the artist wished to paint a picture that would make us hear the bell sounding clearly across the deep stillness of the open field he wished to make us feel as do these peasants the quiet solemnity of the hour even as a little boy millet was greatly impressed by the sound of the angelus or bell for prayers which was rung each morning noon and night one of his earliest remembrances was of a time when the villagers bought new bells for the church and he went with his mother and a neighbor to see them before they were hung it seems that two of the old bells had been used to make a cannon the third was broken and these new bells were in the church waiting to be baptized before they could be hung in the tower they seemed immense to the small boy and of course they must have been larger than he millet tells of the delight and awe he felt when the neighbor struck the bells with the great key to the church door which she carried in her hand no wonder then that this picture was one of millets favorites for it reminded him of his boyhood home and brought back memories of the thoughts and experiences of his childhood grown to manhood and himself a peasant he too had heard the angelus sounded forth from the village church tower and had dropped his work to bow his head in prayer the quiet and peace of such moments had left a deep impression which he wished to share with us the long stretch of field suggests the industry of the peasants the distant church and their bowed heads against the bright sky tell us of their faith can you not see them on their homeward journey the man pushing the wheelbarrow with its heavy load while the woman carries the basket it looks as if it would be a long tiresome tramp across the uneven field to the village so dimly visible in the distance this is the time of year when the peasants work is hardest for during the winter there is little farm work to do we are told that the women spend their winter days in spinning weaving cloth and making clothes while the men weave baskets make their garden tools and do what little work there is to do the very simplicity of this landscape with its lack of details is part of its great charm the quiet dignity of the man and woman standing with bowed heads the peace and quiet of the scene and above all the sound of the sweettoned angelus give us a feeling of restfulness and peace the horizon line is high in this picture yet the sky space is large enough to contain the heads and shoulders of our two peasants in this way we are made to feel that although they are bound to earth and are a part of it their thoughts soar higher there is another life besides the one of toil and privation at the time millet painted this great picture he was wretchedly poor he sent the picture to a friend in paris begging him to sell it and send the money as soon as possible it sold for less than five hundred dollars yet not many years ago a french collector paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this same picture the angelus they stand within the field at prayer the rustic man and maid while silvery thro the amber air the angels song is played they bow their heads in gratitude for gift of life and health and for content—their highest good and love—their only wealth there is a closeness to the soil in both their garb and mien that tells of happiness and toil and quiet peace serene a lark above them sings and sings a song of hope and youth theirs is the joy of common things— the beauty of the truth —edward wilbur mason questions to help the pupil understand the picture what time of day does this picture represent what can you see in the distance in what direction is the woman facing how can you tell what have these peasants been doing why have they stopped their work why is the picture called the angelus tell about millet and the new bells for the church tell something of the life of these peasants how did the artist millet know so much about their life what can you say about the composition of this picture what was the financial condition of the artist when he painted this picture what did he do with this painting about how much is it worth now the story of the artist let us try to imagine the artist jean françois millet as a young man nineteen years old on his first visit to the great city of paris brought up on a farm among the lowliest of the french peasants he had met few except those with whom he labored in the fields or those who poorer than they were made welcome under the ever hospitable roof of the elder millets these neighbors and friends were mostly sailors or farmers who looked upon the journey to paris as a great event as indeed it was for weeks the kind old grandmother had kept her spinning wheel busy spinning and weaving the cloth for his new suit of clothes she was the tailor who cut stitched and pressed them all her savings of years had been sewed into a belt and given to him for this journey as he stood in the doorway waiting for the old stagecoach which presently came rattling down the stone road of the village he must have felt anew the great sacrifices they were all so willing to make to send him where he could study his beloved art in paris millet presented an unusual appearance—six feet in height slender a downy beard on his face his brown hair hanging to his shoulders all his belongings were neatly packed in the sailors canvas bag which he carried over his shoulder is it any wonder that many did not see the straightforward honest manly look of the calm gray eyes there was in that gaze and in the rude bearing a certain quiet confidence and strength which only the home folks recognized and valued the boy could draw and draw well they knew and had not the drawing master of the village told them he would surely one day become a great artist tired from the three days ride in the old stagecoach jostled by the hurrying crowds for it was evening and all were on their way home he stood confused a policeman catching sight of the stupidlooking youth blocking the sidewalk with his great bag asked him where he wanted to go is it any wonder that he answered back to gruchy we are told that he even inquired when the next coach left for gruchy but there was none until morning the policeman sent him to a boarding house of moderate prices and the next morning he started out to find the great art gallery of the louvre he had attempted to inquire the way at the boarding house but the boarders laughed at his normandy accent and strange appearance and he did not wait for the answer and so he wandered the streets for three days not daring to ask the way for fear of being laughed at again until at last he stood before the great gallery recognizing it at once by the pictures he had seen of it in writing of it years later millet says my feelings were too great for words and i closed my eyes lest i be dazzled by the sight and then dared not open them lest i should find it all a dream and if i ever reach paradise i know my joy will be no greater than it was that first morning when i realized that i stood within the louvre palace in the meantime he had found a room and place to board near by the landlady having suggested that he had better not carry much money about with him he immediately gave her all he had to keep for him that was the last he saw of his money he spent a week just visiting the louvre and finally became acquainted with a student who was copying one of the paintings this student took him to the artist delaroche who after looking at his sketches gladly admitted him as a pupil the other students were greatly amused at millets awkward appearance and called him the man of the woods it was almost impossible to persuade him to talk and his answers to all questions were in monosyllables but if pressed too hard he could use his fists effectively they soon found out too that he could paint and paint well all idea of going home was given up and millet spent twelve years in paris enduring poverty and hunger but working faithfully and long when he went back to his home for a visit he was so nearly starved that he fell fainting on the ground when he tried to work in the fields millet painted landscapes portraits and signs but fortune never seemed to smile on him long at a time people said his pictures did not sell because he painted such common things and such poor people instead of choosing beautiful girls or fine gentlemen for his models but he painted the people he knew about and loved best—the french peasants—and as their lives were full of toil he must represent them at their labor returning to paris and finding his life there still one of continuous struggle with poverty millet with his wife and children went to live at barbizon a small village a days ride from paris many descriptions have been written and pictures painted of the modest white stone cottage with its clinging vines and its thrifty gardens in which he spent the rest of his life it was not until the last few years of his life that he ceased to be wretchedly poor for then at last his pictures were appreciated and he received the profit and honor that were his due he died at barbizon january 20 1875 questions about the artist tell about millets early training and the preparations made for his journey to paris how did he travel describe his first evening in paris how did he find the great gallery of the louvre why did he not inquire the way what became of his money with whom did he study and how did this happen what did the other students call him why did they do this how many years did he stay in paris what was his success there why did his pictures not sell where did he finally go to live when were his paintings appreciated illustration sheep in spring sheep in spring questions to arouse interest what is there in this picture that suggests the time of year what are the sheep doing how many have watched sheep eat grass why do the shepherd and his dog stand in front of them of what use is the shepherds crook or staff what do you see in the distance do you think this is a scene in our own country or in some foreign country how are the sheep farthest away represented where does the light fall upon the sheep and upon the man what kinds of lines are there in this picture tell some of the duties of a shepherd of a shepherds dog why do sheep need so much care of what use are they why do you like this picture original picture metropolitan museum new york city artist anton mauve mōv birthplace zaandam the netherlands dates born 1838 died 1888 the story of the picture the artist has taken us to his own native country showing us the beauties of the fields in spring and giving us much of their feeling of calm and contentment the shepherd has led his sheep safely past the freshly plowed field which we see at the left of the picture and now he stands in front of them so they will go more slowly and eat the grass closer if one of the sheep should go too fast he would probably reach out with his long crook which he would place around the sheeps neck and draw it back the dog too would do his part to keep it where it ought to be sheep prefer to run ahead taking a bit of grass here and a bit there but when they are held back by the man and dog as in this picture they will mow the grass as closely and thoroughly as if a lawnmower had passed over it as we look at the picture we find that though few details are shown the sheep in the first row are distinct while the rest are merely suggested anton mauve has become famous for this very thing—the omission of minor details in his pictures and the simplicity with which he thus tells his story we feel the warmth and vigor of this beautiful day in spring the fresh green grass with here and there a flower to relieve the green the soft green leaves of the young and slender trees planted on each side of the road at the right of the picture this road probably leads direct to the farmhouse we see in the distance the long meadow too seems to reach as far as that same farmhouse and no doubt will provide pasture all summer for the sheep their fleecy white wool will grow long then will come sheepshearing time and the wool will be sent away to be woven into cloth in the picture the light falls strongly upon the backs of the sheep on the head and shoulders of the man and on the wooden shoes he wears the dog stands there expectant ready to pursue any wayward sheep it is wonderful how much these shepherd dogs know and how much they help their owners in some countries the sheep are kept out in the fields or among the hills all night the shepherd rolls himself up in a blanket and sleeps securely near them knowing full well that the faithful dog will remain on guard allowing none to stray away or come to harm sometimes when the shepherd wishes to collect his flock and drive them to the fold or inclosure for the night many of them have wandered up into the mountains to almost inaccessible heights but the dog will find them every one he has a way of making the sheep understand what they are expected to do he circles around and around them so quickly that none can escape and he seems to have some mysterious way of counting them for if one is missing off he goes seldom failing to return with it the story is told of a shepherd who with but one dog was guarding seven hundred lambs at midnight they suddenly took fright and dividing into three sections disappeared over the hills the man could do nothing until daylight but the morning found the lambs gathered in a valley and guarded by the faithful dog from whose vigilance not one had escaped these intelligent shepherd dogs can be made to understand their masters wishes even at a great distance for they understand and obey motions made with the hands sheep are more helpless than most animals because they cannot defend themselves against wild animals and because having no sense of locality they are so easily lost or led astray if a flock of sheep is attacked by wolves and there are several dogs guarding the flock very often the dogs will circle around the sheep until they have crowded them as close together as they can then one of the dogs will continue walking around them while the others attack and usually beat off the wolves illustration sheep in autumn anton mauve has painted a companion picture to this one the two pictures hang on the same wall in the metropolitan museum new york city the companion picture is called sheep in autumn and as the name suggests it represents a scene in the fall of the year the first picture brings to our mind visions of green meadows newly ploughed fields tender grass and tiny green leaves quickening into life and beauty with the arrival of the mild days of spring but the second picture has a different story to tell it is autumn now the leaves and grass have ripened to a reddish brown and the grain has been gathered from the field at the right of the picture the sheep are turned away from us here and it is not necessary for the shepherd and his dog to hold them back there is no young and tender grass to tempt them and they are going home there are many young lambs with the flock now born since their mothers went out to pasture and they lag behind the rest as if the journey were a long one we can almost hear the shrill bleating of the little lambs mingled with the deeper calls of the sheep as they move along the road the shepherd this time an old man in the autumn of his life tenderly carries a little weak lamb under his arm perhaps after it has rested he will take up another tired one the dog looks older too no doubt he has had a hard summer of it with the care of all these sheep and their lambs by the long shadows mauve has told us that it is the end of the day as well as the end of the year there is a strong appeal in this picture when we think of the homecoming of this little company—the tired young lambs following their mothers the tired dog that will now have a long rest and the kind old shepherd with the helpless lamb under his arm through both these pictures mauve has expressed the same sympathy with and love for nature and its many changes of season and weather it is difficult indeed to choose one for study in preference to the other and it is perhaps for that reason that they are usually studied together in our picture of the sheep in spring with all its suggestions of growth and beauty the grass and leaves are luxuriant and yet the days and nights are still too cool for the sheep to be sheared when the warm days come the shepherd will probably drive his flock to the river or some clear stream where in spite of strugglings to escape their long woolly coats will be scrubbed and cleaned then when the wool is thoroughly dried it will be cut off with large shears and sent to the manufactories where it will be made into cloth for the garments we wear long ago in our great grandmothers day wool was carded spun and woven into cloth by hand many families still keep the old spinning wheels and hand looms which were used in those times questions to help the pupil understand the picture in what country was this picture painted what time of year is represented why does the shepherd keep the sheep back how can he prevent them from going too fast how do the sheep prefer to eat the grass what can you see at the right of the picture what is on each side of this road to what does it lead of what use are the sheep in what ways can the dog help the shepherd how does he keep the sheep together tell about the dog and the seven hundred lambs how can a trained dog understand his master even at a distance in what ways are sheep helpless how can a dog protect them from wolves what is the companion picture to this one called how does it differ from this painting which one do you like best why where are the original paintings the story of the artist anton mauve was born near the sea in a little village called zaandam the netherlands his father was a protestant clergyman in this thriving little town known for its oil and paper mills and its extensive timber trade when anton was but a boy the family moved to haarlem where he grew to manhood his talent for drawing was soon discovered but it did not meet with any favor at home his fathers strong objections to his becoming an artist were finally overcome by a compromise if anton would promise to win a diploma as a drawing master so that he would be sure of earning his living in case he failed as an artist then his father would give his consent as definite rules were laid down for teaching drawing and these rules permitted little or no originality anton mauve found his promise very hard to keep however he persevered when the course was finished he packed his grip and with little in his purse started for the village of oosterbeek where a number of other artists lived and worked later he settled in amsterdam where he worked hard earning enough with his painting to support himself mauve painted a great number of pictures many of them in water color he is best known by his flocks of sheep which he represents in all seasons and in every kind of weather although he lived by the sea very few of mauves pictures were of the sea for he preferred the country roads leading through green fields with here and there a flock of sheep or herd of cattle he seldom painted a landscape without some figure in it—a woodcart a man on horseback a peasant woman or a woodcutter were his most frequent models the birch tree with its graceful silvery stem was his favorite tree it is said that mauve was in the habit of making his sketches on his cuffs and by keeping the colors in his mind he was able from these suggestions to paint the pictures which soon brought him fame and honor questions about the artist who painted this picture where was he born what compromise did he make with his father why did he find it difficult to do his part what did he do then what subjects might we have expected him to choose for his paintings what subjects did he choose upon what did he often make his first sketches how did he finish these pictures what were his favorite models what was his favorite tree the suggestions to teachers studying the picture several days before the lesson is to be taken up the picture to be studied should be placed where every pupil can see it first of all the children should find out for themselves what is in the picture the questions accompanying the story of each picture are intended to help them to do this language work the pupils should be encouraged in class to talk freely and naturally in this way the lesson becomes a language exercise in which the pupils will gain in freedom of expression and in the ability to form clear mental images if a lesson does not occupy the entire drawing period the children should be asked to retell the story of the picture dramatization and drawing most of the stories told by the pictures lend themselves readily to dramatization and whenever practicable such stories should be acted out the stories also offer numerous interesting situations that may be used as subjects for drawing lessons the review lesson the review lesson should cover all pictures and artists studied throughout the year at this time other pictures available by the same artists should be on exhibition the review work may be conducted as a contest in which the pictures are held up one at a time while the class writes the name of the picture and the artist on slips of paper which have been prepared and numbered for that purpose one teacher who used this device surprised her class by presenting those whose lists were correct with their choice of any of the largesized perry pictures studied many teachers however will prefer to use this time for composition work although the description of pictures is often given as an english lesson pupils may write a description of their favorite picture in fact the lessons can be made to correlate with history geography english spelling reading or nature study in any event the real purpose of the work is that the pupils shall become so familiar with the pictures that they will recognize them as old friends whenever and wherever they may see them it is hoped that acquaintance with the picture and the interest awakened by its story will grow into a fuller appreciation and understanding of the artists work thus the children will have many happy hours and will learn to love the good the true and the beautiful in everything about them transcribers

wishingstone tommy scuffed his bare brown feet in the grass and didnt even notice how cooling and refreshing to his bare toes the green blades were usually he just loved to feel them but this afternoon he just didnt want to find anything pleasant or nice in the things he was accustomed to a scowl a deep dark heavy scowl had chased all merriment from his round freckled face it seemed as if the very freckles were trying to hide from it tommy didnt care he said so he said so right out loud he didnt care if all the world knew it he wanted the world to know it it was a horrid old world anyway this world which made a fellow go hunt up and drive home a lot of pesky cows just when all the other fellows were over at the swimminghole it always was that way whenever there was anything interesting or particular to do or any fun going on yes it was a horrid old world this world in which tommy lived and he was quite willing that everybody should know it the truth was tommy was deep very deep in the sulks he was so deep in them that he couldnt see jolly round mr sun smiling down on him he couldnt see anything lovely in the beautiful broad green meadows with the shadows of the clouds chasing one another across them he couldnt hear the music of the birds and the bees he couldnt even hear the merry little breezes whispering secrets as they danced around him he couldnt see and hear becausewell because he wouldnt see and hear that is always the way with people who go way down deep in the sulks presently he came to a great big stone tommy stopped and scowled at it just as he had been scowling at everybody and everything he scowled at it as if he thought it had no business to be there yet all the time he was glad that it was there it was just the right size to sit on and try to make himself happy by being perfectly miserable you know some people actually find pleasure in thinking how miserable they are the more miserable they can make themselves feel the sooner they begin to pity themselves and when they begin to pity themselves they seem to find what uncle jason calls a melancholy pleasure it was that way with tommy because no one else seemed to pity him he wanted to pity himself and to do that right he must first make himself feel the most miserable he possibly could so he sat down on the big stone waved his stick for a few moments and then threw it away put his chin in his two hands and his two elbows on his two knees and began by scowling down at his bare brown toes theres never anything to do around here and when there is a fellow cant do it he grumbled other fellows dont have to weed the garden and bring in wood and drive the cows and when they do it it isnt just when they want to have some fun whats vacation for if it isnt to have a good time in and hows a fellow going to do it when he has to work all the timeanyway when he has to work just when he doesnt want to he was trying to be truthful fellows who live in town have something going on all the time while out here theres nothing but fields and woods and sky andand cows that havent sense enough to come home themselves when its time theres never anything exciting or intresting round here i wish he suddenly became aware of two very small bright eyes watching him from a little opening in the grass he scowled at them harder than ever and moved ever so little the eyes disappeared but a minute later they were back again full of curiosity a little doubtful a little fearful but tremendously interested they were the eyes of danny meadow mouse tommy knew them right away of course he did hadnt he chased danny with sticks and stones time and again but he didnt think of this now he was too full of his own troubles to remember that others had troubles too somehow dannys twinkling little eyes seemed to mock him how unjust things were you dont have to work he exploded so suddenly and fiercely that danny gave a frightened squeak and took to his heels you dont have anything to do but play all day and have a good time i wish i was a meadowmouse right then and there something happened tommy didnt know how it happened but it just did instead of a barelegged frecklefaced sulky boy sitting on the big stone he suddenly found himself a little chunky bluntheaded furry animal with four short legs and a ridiculously short stubby tail and he was scampering after danny meadow mouse along a private little path through the meadowgrass he was a meadowmouse himself his wish had come true tommy felt very happy he had forgotten that he ever was a boy he raced along the private little path just as if he had always been accustomed to just such private little paths it might be very hot out in the sun but down there among the sheltering grass stems it was delightfully cool and comfortable he tried to shout for very joy but what he really did do was to squeak it was a thin sharp little squeak it was answered right away from in front of him and tommy didnt like the sound of it being a meadowmouse now he understood the speech of meadowmice and he knew that danny meadow mouse was demanding to know who was running in his private little path tommy suspected by the angry sound of dannys voice that he meant to fight tommy hesitated then he stopped he didnt want to fight you see he knew that he had no business in that path without an invitation from the owner if it had been his own path he would have been eager to fight but it wasnt and so he thought it best to avoid trouble he turned and scampered back a little way to a tiny branch path he followed this until it also branched and then took the new path but none of these paths really belonged to him he wanted some of his very own now the only way to have a private path of your very own in the green meadows is to make it unless you are big enough and strong enough to take one away from some one else so tommy set to work to make a path of his own and he did it by cutting the grass one stem at a time the very tender ones he ate the dry ones he carried to an old board he had discovered and under this he made a nest using the finest softest grasses for the inside of course it was work as a matter of fact had he as a boy had to work onetenth as much or as hard as he now had to work as a meadowmouse he would have felt sure that he was the most abused boy who ever lived but being a meadowmouse he didnt think anything about it and scurried back and forth as fast as ever he could just stopping now and then to rest he knew that he must work for everything he hadthat without work he would have nothing and somehow this all seemed perfectly right he was busy and in keeping busy he kept happy presently as he sat down to rest a minute a merry little breeze came hurrying along and brought with it just the faintest kind of a sound it made his heart jump every little unexpected sound made his heart jump he listened with all his might there it was again something was stealing very very softly through the grass he felt sure it was danger of some kind then he did a foolish thinghe ran you see he was so frightened that he felt that he just couldnt sit still a second longer so he ran the instant he moved something big and terrible sprang at him and two great paws with sharp claws spread out all but landed on him he gave a frightened squeak and darted under a fallen old fencepost that lay half hidden in the tall grass whats the matter with you demanded a voice tommy found that he had company it was another meadowmouse iive had such a narrow escape panted tommy a terrible creature with awful claws almost caught me the stranger peeped out to see pooh said he that was only a cat cats dont know much if you keep your ears and eyes open its easy enough to fool cats but they are a terrible nuisance just the same because they are always prowling around when you least expect them i hate cats it is bad enough to have to watch out all the time for enemies who live on the green meadows without having to be always looking to see if a cat is about a cat hasnt any excuse at all it has all it wants to eat without trying to catch us it hunts just out of love of cruelty now reddy fox has some excuse he has to eat too bad hes so fond of meadowmice speaking of reddy have you seen him lately tommy shook his head i guess its safe enough to go out now continued the stranger i know where there is a lot of dandy corn lets go get some tommy was quite willing the stranger led the way first he looked this way and that way and listened for any sound of danger tommy did likewise but the way seemed clear and away they scampered right away tommy was happy again he had forgotten his recent fright that is the way with little people of the green meadows but he didnt forget to keep his ears and his eyes wide open for new dangers they reached the corn safely and then such a feast as they did have it seemed to tommy that never had he tasted anything half so good right in the midst of the feast the stranger gave a faint little squeak and darted under a pile of old cornstalks tommy didnt stop to ask questions but followed right at his heels a big black shadow swept over them and then passed on tommy peeped out there was a great bird with huge broad wings sailing back and forth over the meadows its old whitetail the marsh hawk he didnt get us that time chuckled the stranger and crept back to the delicious corn in two minutes they were having as good a time as before just as if they hadnt had a narrow escape when they had eaten all they could hold the stranger went back to his old fencepost and tommy returned to his own private paths and the snug nest he had built under the old board he was sleepy and he curled up for a good long nap when he awoke the first stars were beginning to twinkle down at him from the sky and black shadows lay over the green meadows he found that he could see quite as well as in the light of day and because he was already hungry again he started out to look for something to eat something inside warned him that he must watch out for danger now just as sharply as before though the black shadows seemed to promise safety just what he was to watch out for he didnt know still every few steps he stopped to look and listen he found that this was visiting time among the meadowmice and he made a great many friends there was a great deal of scurrying back and forth along private little paths and a great deal of squeaking at least that is what tommy would have called it had he still been a boy but as it was he understood it perfectly for it was meadowmouse language suddenly not a sound was to be heard not a single squeak or the sound of scurrying feet tommy sat perfectly still and held his breath he didnt know why but something inside told him to and he did then something passed over him it was like a black shadow and it was just as silent as a black shadow but tommy knew that it wasnt a black shadow for out of it two great round fierce yellow eyes glared down and struck such terror to his heart that it almost stopped beating but they didnt see him and he gave a tiny sigh of relief as he watched the grim living shadow sail on while he watched there was a frightened little squeak two legs with great curved claws dropped down from the shadow plunged into the grass and when they came up again they held a little limp form a little mouse had moved when he shouldnt have and hooty the owl had caught a dinner a dozen times that night tommy sat quite frozen with fear while hooty passed but after each time he joined with his fellows in merrymaking just as if there was no such thing as this terrible feathered hunter with the silent wings only each one was ready to hide at the first sign of danger when he grew tired of playing and eating he returned to his snug nest under the old board to sleep he was still asleep there the next morning when without any warning the old board was lifted in great fright tommy ran out of his nest and at once there was a great shout from a huge giant who struck at him with a stick and then chased him throwing sticks and stones none of which hit him but which frightened him terribly he dodged down a little path and ran for his life while behind him he heard the giant it was just a boy shouting and laughing as he poked about in the grass trying to find poor tommy and tommy wondered what he could be laughing about and what fun there could be in frightening a poor little meadowmouse almost to death later that very same morning while he was hard at work cutting a new path he heard footsteps behind him and turned to see a big black bird stalking along the little path he didnt wait for closer acquaintance but dived into the thick grass and as he did so the big black bird made a lunge at him but missed him it was his first meeting with blacky the crow and he had learned of one more enemy to watch out for illustration blacky the crow but most of all he feared reddy fox he never could be quite sure when reddy was about sometimes it would be in broad daylight and sometimes in the stilly night the worst of it was reddy seemed to know all about the ways of meadowmice and would lie perfectly still beside a little path until an unsuspecting mouse came along then there would be a sudden spring a little squeak cut short right in the middle and there would be one less happy little worker and playmate so tommy learned to look and listen before he started for any place and then to scurry as fast as ever he could twice mr gopher snake almost caught him and once he got away from billy mink by squeezing into a hole between some roots too small for billy to get in it was a very exciting life very exciting indeed he couldnt understand why when all he wanted was to be allowed to mind his own business and work and play in peace he must be forever running or hiding for his life he loved the sweet meadowgrasses and the warm sunshine he loved to hear the bees humming and the birds singing he thought the green meadows the most beautiful place in all the great world and he was very happy when he wasnt frightened but there was hardly an hour of the day or night that he didnt have at least one terrible fright still it was good to be alive and explore new places there was a big rock in front of him right now he wondered if there was anything to eat on top of it sometimes he found the very nicest seeds in the cracks of big rocks this one looked as if it would not be very hard to scramble up on he felt almost sure that he would find some treasure up there he looked this way and that way to make sure no one was watching then he scrambled up on the big rock for a few minutes tommy stared out over the green meadows they were very beautiful it seemed to him that they never had been so beautiful or the songs of the birds so sweet or the merry little breezes the children of old mother west wind so soft and caressing he couldnt understand it all for he wasnt a meadowmousejust a barefooted boy sitting on a big stone that was just made to sit on as he looked down he became aware of two very small bright eyes watching him from a little opening in the grass he knew them right away of course he did they were the eyes of danny meadow mouse they were filled with curiosity a little doubtful a little fearful but tremendously interested tommy smiled and felt in his pocket for some crackercrumbs danny ran away at the first move but tommy scattered the crumbs where he could find them as he was sure to come back tommy stood up and stretched then he turned and looked curiously at the stone on which he had been sitting i believe its a real wishingstone said he then he laughed aloud im glad im not a meadowmouse but just a boy he cried i guess those cows are wondering what has become of me he started toward the pasture and now there was no frown darkening his freckled face it was clear and good to see and he whistled as he trampled along once he stopped and grinned sheepishly as his blue eyes drank in the beauty of the green meadows and beyond them the green forest and i said there was nothing interesting or exciting going on here why its the most exciting place i ever heard of only i didnt know it before he muttered gee i am glad im not a meadowmouse and if ever i throw sticks or stones at one again iwell i hope i turn into one and though danny meadow mouse timidly nibbling at the crackercrumbs didnt know it he had one less enemy to be afraid of chapter two how tommy learned to admire thunderer the ruffed grouse from over in the green forest where the silver beeches grow came a sound which made tommy stop to listen for a minute or two all was still then it came again a deep throbbing sound that began slowly and then grew faster and faster until it ended in a long rumble like distant thunder tommy knew it couldnt be that for there wasnt a cloud in the sky and anyway it wasnt the season of thunderstorms again he heard that deep hollow throbbing grow fast and faster until there was no time between the beats and it became a thunderous rumble and for some reason which he could not have explained tommy felt his pulse beat faster in unison and a strange sense of joyous exhilaration drumdrumdrumdrumdrum drum drum drrrrrrum the sound beat out from beyond the hemlocks and rolled away through the woods its an old cockpartridge drumming tommy had a way of talking to himself when he was alone hes down on that old beech log at the head of the gully gee id like to see him bet its the same one that was there last year dad says that old log is a reglar drumminglog and hes seen partridges drum there lots of times and yet he doesnt really know how they make all that noise says some folks say they beat the log with their wings and because its hollow it makes that sound dont believe it though theyd break their wings doing that besides that old log isnt much hollow anyway and i never can make it sound up much hammering it with a stick so how could a partridge do it with nothing but his wings some other folks say they do it by hitting their wings together over their backs but i dont see any sense in that because their wings are mostly feathers and some say they beat their sides to make the noise but if they do that i should think theyd knock all the wind out of themselves and be too sore to move bet if i could ever catch ol thunderer drumming id find out how he does it i know what ill do ill go over to the old wishingstone wonder why i didnt think of it before then ill find out a lot he thrust his hands into his pockets and trudged up the crooked little path out of the green forest and over to the great gray stone on the edge of the green meadows where once a wish had come true or had seemed to come true anyway and where he had learned so much about the life of danny meadow mouse as he tramped his thoughts were all of thunderer the ruffed grouse whom he called a partridge and some other people call a pheasant but who is neither many times had tommy been startled by having the handsome bird spring into the air from almost under his feet with a noise of wings that was enough to scare anybody it was because of this and the noise of his drumming that tommy called him thunderer with a long sigh of satisfaction for he was tired tommy sat down on the wishingstone planted his elbows on his knees dropped his chin in his hands looked over to the green forest through halfclosed eyes and wished i wish said he slowly and earnestly i could be a partridge he meant of course that he could be a grouse just as had happened before when he had expressed such a wish on the old wishingstone the very instant the words were out of his mouth he ceased to be a boy he was a tiny little bird like nothing so much as a teeny weeny chicken a soft little ball of brown and yellow one of a dozen who all looked alike as they scurried after their little brown mother in answer to her anxious cluck behind them on the ground cunningly hidden back of a fallen tree was an empty nest with only some bits of shell as a reminder that just a few hours before it had contained twelve buff eggs now tommy and his brothers and sisters didnt give the old nest so much as a thought they had left it as soon as they were strong enough to run they were starting out for their first lesson in the school of the great world perhaps tommy thought his mother fussy and altogether a great deal too nervous but if he did he didnt say so there was one thing that seemed to have been born in him something that as a boy he had to learn and that was the habit of instant obedience it was instinct which so naturalists say is habit confirmed and handed down through many generations tommy didnt know why he obeyed he just did that was all it didnt occur to him that there was anything else to do the idea of disobeying never entered his funny pretty little head and it was just so with all the others mother grouse had only to speak and they did just exactly what she told them to this habit of obedience on their part took a great load from the mind of mother grouse they hadnt been in the great world long enough to know but she knew that there were dangers on every side and to watch out for and protect them from these she needed all her senses and she couldnt afford to dull any of them by useless worrying so it was a great relief to her to know that when she had bidden them hide and keep perfectly still until she called them they would do exactly as she said this made it possible for her to leave them long enough to lead an enemy astray and be sure that when she returned she would find them just where she had left them she had to do this twice on their very first journey into the great world tommy was hurrying along with the others as fast as his small legs could take him when his mother gave a sharp but low call to hide there was a dried leaf on the ground close to tommy instantly he crept under it and flattened his small self to the ground closed his eyes tight and listened with all his might he heard the whir of strong wings as mother grouse took flight if he had peeped out he would have seen that she flew only a very little way and that when she came to earth again there appeared to be something the matter with her so that she flopped along instead of running or flying but he didnt see this because he was under that dead leaf presently the ground vibrated under the steps of heavy feet that all but trod on the leaf under which tommy lay and frightened him terribly but he did not move and he made no sound again had he peeped out he would have seen mother grouse fluttering along the ground just ahead of an eager boy who thought to catch her and tried and tried until he had been led far from the place where her babies were then all was still so still that surely there could be no danger near surely it was safe to come out now but tommy didnt move nor did any of his brothers and sisters they had been told not to until they were called and it never once entered their little heads to disobey mother knew best at last there came a gentle cluck instantly tommy popped out from under his leaf to see his brothers and sisters popping out from the most unexpected places all about him it seemed almost as if they had popped out of the very ground itself and there was mother grouse very proud and very fussy as she made sure that all her babies were there later that same day the same thing happened only this time there was no heavy footstep but the lightest kind of patter as cushioned feet eagerly hurried past and reddy fox sprang forward sure that mother grouse was to make him the dinner he liked best and thus was led away to a safe distance there to realize how completely he had been fooled it was a wonderful day that first day there was a great anthill which mother grouse scratched open with her stout claws exposing ever and ever so many white things which were the socalled eggs of the big black ants and which were delicious eating as tommy soon found out it was great fun to scramble for them and eat and eat until not another one could be swallowed and when the shadow began to creep through the green forest they nestled close under mother grouse in one of her favorite secret hidingplaces and straightway went to sleep as healthy children should sure that no harm could befall them nor once guessed how lightly their mother slept and more than once shivered with fear not for herself but for them as some prowler of the night passed their retreat so the days passed and tommy grew and learned and it was a question which he did the faster the down with which he had been covered gave way to real feathers and he grew real wings so that he was little over a week old when he could fly in case of need and in that same length of time short as it was he had filled his little head with knowledge he had learned that a big sandy dome in a sunny spot in the woods usually meant an ants castle where he could eat to his hearts content if only it was torn open for him he had learned that luscious fat worms and bugs were to be found under rotting pieces of bark and the litter of decaying old logs and stumps he had learned that wild strawberries and some other berries afforded a welcome variety to his bill of fare illustration bugs were to be found under old logs he had learned that a daily bath in fine dust was necessary for cleanliness as well as being vastly comforting he had learned that danger lurked in the air as well as on the ground for a swooping hawk had caught one of his brothers who had not instantly heeded his mothers warning but most important of all he had learned the value of that first lesson in obedience and to trust wholly to the wisdom of mother grouse and never to question her commands a big handsome grouse had joined them now it was old thunderer and sometimes when he would throw back his head spread his beautiful tail until it was like a fan raise the crest on his head and the glossy ruff on his neck and proudly strut ahead of them tommy thought him the most beautiful sight in all the world and wondered if ever he would grow to be half as handsome while he did little work in the care of the brood thunderer was of real help to mother grouse in guarding the little family from everlurking dangers there was no eye or ear more keen than his and none more skillful than he in confusing and baffling a hungry enemy who had chanced to discover the presence of the little family tommy watched him every minute he could spare from the ever important business of filling his crop and stored up for future need the things he learned once he ventured to ask thunderer what was the greatest danger for which a grouse must watch out and he never forgot the answer there is no greatest danger while you are young replied thunderer shaking out his feathers every danger is greatest while it exists never forget that never treat any danger lightly skunks and foxes and weasels and minks and coons and hawks and owls are equally dangerous to youngsters like you and one is as much to be feared as another it is only when you have become fullgrown like me and then only in the fall of the year that you will know the greatest danger and what is that asked tommy timidly a man with a gun replied thunderer and what is that asked tommy again eager for knowledge a great creature who walks on two legs and points a stick which spits fire and smoke and makes a great noise and kills while it is yet a long distance off oh gasped tommy how is one ever to learn to avoid such a dreadful danger as that ill teach you when the time comes replied thunderer now run along and take your dustbath you must first learn to avoid other dangers before you will be fitted to meet the greatest danger all that long bright summer tommy thought of that greatest danger and by learning how to meet other dangers tried to prepare himself for it sometimes he wondered if there really could be any greater danger than those about him every day it seemed sometimes as if all the world sought to kill him who was so harmless himself not only were there dangers from hungry animals and robbers of the air but also from the very creatures that furnished him much of his livingthe tribe of insects an uglylooking insect called a tick with wicked bloodsucking jaws killed one of the brood while they were yet small and an equally ugly worm called a botworm caused the death of another shadow the weasel surprised one foolish bird who insisted on sleeping on the ground when he was big enough to know better and reddy fox dined on another whose curiosity led him to move when he had been warned to lie perfectly still and who paid for his disobedience with his life tommy not three feet away saw it all and profited by the lesson he was big enough now to act for himself and no longer depended wholly for safety on the wisdom of mother grouse and thunderer but while he trusted to his own senses and judgment he was ever heedful of their example and still ready to learn especially did he take pains to keep near thunderer and study him and his ways for he was wise and cunning with the cunning of experience and knowledge tommy was filled with great admiration for him and tried to copy him in everything thus it was that he learned that there were two ways of flying one without noise and the other with the thunder of whirring wings also he learned that there was a time for each when he knew himself to be alone and suddenly detected the approach of an enemy he often would launch himself into the air on silent wings before his presence had been discovered but when others of his family were near he would burst into the air with all the noise he could make as a warning to others also it sometimes startled and confused the enemy thunderer had taught him the trick one day when reddy fox had stolen unseen by tommy almost within jumping distance thunderer had seen him and purposely had waited until reddy was just gathering himself to spring on the unsuspecting tommy then with a splendid roar of his stout wings thunderer had risen just to one side of the fox so startling him and distracting his attention that tommy had had ample time to whir up in his turn to the discomfiture of reddy fox so when the fall came tommy was big from good living and filled with the knowledge that makes for long life among grouse he knew the best scratchinggrounds the choicest feedingplaces according to the month every brambletangle and every brushpile the place for the warmest sunbath and the trees which afforded the safest and most comfortable roosting places at night he knew the ways and the favorite huntinggrounds of every fox and weasel and skunk and coon of the neighborhood and how to avoid them he knew when it was safest to lie low and trust to the protective coloring of his feathers and when it was best to roar away on thundering wings the days grew crisp and shorter the maples turned red and yellow and soon the woods were filled with fluttering leaves and the trees began to grow bare it was then that old thunderer warned tommy that the season of greatest danger was at hand somehow in the confidence of his strength and the joy of the splendid tide of life surging through him he didnt fear this unknown danger as he had when as a little fellow he had first heard of it then one day quite unexpectedly he faced it he and thunderer had been resting quietly in a brambletangle on the very edge of the green forest when suddenly there was the rustle of padded feet in the leaves just outside the brambles looking out tommy saw what at first he took to be a strange and very large kind of fox and he prepared to fly not yet not yet warned thunderer that is a dog and he will not harm us but to fly now might be to go straight into that greatest danger of which i had told you that is the mistake young grouse often make flying before they know just where the danger is watch until you see the twolegged creature with the firestick then follow me and do just as i do the dog was very near now in fact he had his nose in the brambles and was standing as still as if turned to stone one of his fore feet lifted and pointing straight at them no one moved presently tommy heard heavy steps and looking through the brambles saw the great twolegged creature of whom thunderer had told him now cried thunderer do as i do with a great roar of wings he burst out of the tangle on the opposite side from where the hunter was and flying low so as to keep the brambles between himself and the hunter swerved sharply to the left to put a tree between them and then flew like a bullet straight into the green forest where the trees were thickest skillfully dodging the great trunks and at last at a safe distance sailing up over the tops to take to the ground on the other side of a hill and there run swiftly for a way tommy followed closely doing exactly as thunderer did even as he swerved behind the first tree he heard a terrible double roar behind him and the sharp whistle of things which cut through the leaves around him and struck the tree behind him one even nipped a brown feather from his back he was terribly frightened but he was unhurt as he joined thunderer behind the hill now you know what the greatest danger is said thunderer never fly until you know just where the hunter is and then fly back of a bush or a tree the bigger the better or drop over the edge of a bank if there is one make as much noise as you can when you get up it may startle the hunter so that he cannot point his firestick straight if he has no dog it is sometimes best to lie still until he has passed and then fly silently if there is no tree or other cover near enough when you first see the dog run swiftly until you reach a place where it will be safe to take wing for the next few weeks it seemed as if from daylight to dark the woods were filled with dogs and hunters and tommy knew no hour of peace and security until the coming of night many a dreadful tragedy did tommy see when companions less cunning than old thunderer were stricken in midair and fell lifeless to the ground but he learning quickly and doing as thunderer did escaped unharmed at last the law of which tommy knew nothing put an end to the murder of the innocents and for another year the greatest danger was over but now came a new danger it was the month of madness tommy and all his companions were seized with an irresistible desire to fly aimlessly blindly sometimes in the darkness of night they knew not where and in this mad flight some met death breaking their necks against buildings and against telegraph wires where he went or what he did during this period of madness tommy never knew but when it left him as abruptly as it had come he found himself in the street of a village with swift strong wings he shot into the air and headed straight back for the dear green forest now no longer green save where the hemlocks and pines grew once back there he took up the old life and was happy for he felt himself a match for any foe the days grew shorter and the cold increased there were still seeds and acorns and some berries but with the coming of the snow these became more and more scarce and tommy was obliged to resort to catkins and buds on the trees between his toes there grew little horny projections which were his snowshoes and enabled him to get about on the snow without sinking in he learned to dive into the deep soft snow for warmth and safety once he was nearly trapped there a hard crust formed in the night and when morning came tommy had hard work to break out so the long winter wore away and spring came with all its gladness tommy was fully as big as old thunderer now and just as handsome and he began to take pride in his appearance and to strut one day he came to an old log and jumping up on it strutted back and forth proudly with his fanlike tail spread its fullest and his broad ruff raised then he heard the long rolling thunder of another grouse drumming instantly he began to beat his wings against the air not as in flying but with a more downward motion and to his great delight there rolled from under them that same thunder slowly he beat at first and then faster and faster until he was forced to stop for breath he was drumming then he listened for a reply drumdrumdrumdrumdrum drum drum drrrrrrrum tommys eyes flew open he was sitting on the old wishingstone on the edge of the green meadows for a minute he blinked in confusion then from over in the green forest came that sound like distant thunder drumdrumdrumdrumdrum drum drum drrrrrrrum its ol thunderer again on that beech log cried tommy and now i know how he does it he just beats the air i know because ive done it myself geewhilikens im glad im not really a partridge bet ill never hunt one after this or let anybody else if i can help it isnt this old wishingstone the dandy place to learn things though i guess the only way of really knowing how birds and animals live and feel is by being one of em somehow it makes things look all different just listen to ol thunderer drum i know now just how fine he feels im going to get father to put up a sign and stop all shooting in our part of the green forest next fall and then there wont be any greatest danger there and tommy whistling merrily started for home chapter three what happened when tommy became a mink it was not often that tommy caught so much as a glimpse of billy mink and every time he did he had the feeling that he had been smart very smart indeed the funny thing is that this feeling annoyed tommy yes it did it annoyed him because it seemed so very foolish to think that there was anything smart in just seeing billy mink and yet every time he did see him he had the feeling that he had really done something out of the usual little by little he realized that it was because billy mink himself is so smart and manages to keep out of sight so much of the time that just seeing him once in a while gave him the feeling of being smarter than billy at the same time he was never quite sure that billy didnt intend to be seen somehow that little browncoated scamp always seemed to be playing with him he would appear so suddenly that tommy never could tell just where he came from and he would disappear quite as quickly tommy never could tell where he went he just vanished that was all it was this that made tommy feel that he had been smart to see him at all now tommy had been acquainted with billy mink for a long time that is to say he had known billy by sight more than that he had tried to trap billy and in trying to trap him he had learned some of billys ways in fact tommy had spent a great deal of time trying to catch billy you see he wanted that little brown fur coat of billys because he could sell it but it was very clear that billy wanted that little fur coat himself to wear and also that he knew all about traps so billy still wore his coat and tommy had taken up his traps and put them away with a sigh for the money which he had hoped that that coat would bring him and with a determination that when cold weather should come again he would get it you see it was summer now and the little fur coat was of no value then save to billy himself in truth tommy would have forgotten all about it until autumn came again had not billy suddenly popped out in front of him that very morning while tommy was trying to catch a trout in a certain quiet pool in the laughing brook deep in the green forest tommy had been sitting perfectly still like the good fisherman that he was not making the tiniest sound when he just seemed to feel two eyes fixed on him very very slowly tommy turned his head he did it so slowly that it almost seemed as if he didnt move it at all but careful as he was he had no more than a bare glimpse of a little brown animal who disappeared as by magic its that mink thought tommy and continued to stare at the spot where he had last seen billy the rustle of a leaf almost behind him caused him to forget and to turn quickly again he had just a glimpse of something brown then it was gone where he hadnt the least idea it was gone that was all tommy forgot all about trout it was more fun to try to get a good look at billy mink and to see what he was doing and where he was going tommy remembered all that he had been taught or had read about how to act when trying to watch his little wild neighbors and he did the best he could but all he got was a fleeting glimpse now and then which was most tantalizing at last he gave up and reeled in his fishline then he started for home all the way he kept thinking of billy mink he couldnt get billy out of his head little by little he realized how when all was said and done he didnt know anything about billy that is he didnt really knowhe just guessed at things and here he is one of my neighbors thought tommy i know a great deal about peter rabbit and chatterer the red squirrel and reddy fox and a lot of others but i dont know anything about billy mink and hes too smart to let me find out huh he neednt be so secret about everything im not going to hurt him then into tommys head crept a guilty remembrance of those traps a little flush crept into tommys face anyway im not going to hurt him now he added by this time he had reached the great gray stone on the edge of the green meadows the wishingstone just as a matter of course he sat down on the edge of it he never could get by without sitting down on it it was a very beautiful scene that stretched out before tommy but though he seemed to be gazing out at it he didnt see it at all he was looking through unseeing eyes the fact is he was too busy thinking and his thoughts were all of billy mink it must be great fun to be able to go and come any hour of the day or night and to be so nimble and smart i wish i were a mink said tommy slowly and very earnestly of course you know what happened then the same thing happened that had happened before on the old wishingstone tommy was the very thing he had wished to be he was a mink yes sir tommy was a tiny furry little fellow with brothers and sisters and the nicest little home in a hollow log hidden among bulrushes close by the laughing brook and with a big pile of brush near it indeed one end of the old log was under the brushpile that made the very safest kind of a playground for the little minks it was there that mother mink gave them their first lessons in a game called nowyouseemenowyoudont they thought they were just playing but all the time they were learning something that would be most important and useful to them when they were older tommy was very quick to learn and just as quick in his movements so that it wasnt long before he could outrun outdodge and outhide any of his companions and mother mink began to pay special attention to his education she was proud of him and because she was proud of him she intended to teach him all the mink lore which she knew so tommy was the first of the family to be taken fishing ever since he and his brothers and sisters had been big enough to eat solid food they had had fish as a part of their bill of fare and there was nothing that tommy liked better where they came from he had never bothered to ask all he cared about was the eating of them but now he was actually going to catch some and he felt very important as he glided along behind his mother presently they came to a dark deep pool in the laughing brook mrs mink peered into its depths there was the glint of something silvery down there in the brown water in a flash mrs mink had disappeared in the pool entering the water so smoothly as to hardly make a splash for a moment tommy saw her dark form moving swiftly then he lost it his little eyes blazed with eagerness and excitement as he watched ha what was that there was something moving under water on the other side of the pool then out popped the brown head of mrs mink and in her teeth was a fat trout tommys mouth watered at the sight what a feast he would have illustration out popped the brown head of mrs mink and in her teeth was a fat trout but instead of bringing the fish to him mrs mink climbed out on the opposite bank and disappeared in the brush there tommy swallowed hard with disappointment could it be that he wasnt to have any of it after all in a few minutes mrs mink was back again but there was no sign of the fish then tommy knew that she had hidden it and for just a minute a wicked thought popped into his head he would swim across and hunt for it but mother mink didnt give him a chance though tommy didnt see it there was a twinkle in her eyes as she said now you have seen how easy it is to catch a fish i shall expect you to catch all you eat hereafter come along with me to the next pool and show me how well you have learned your lesson she led the way down the laughing brook and presently they came to another little brown pool eagerly tommy peered into it at first he saw nothing then almost under him he discovered a fat trout lazily watching for a good meal to come along with a great splash tommy dived into the pool for just a second he closed his eyes as he struck the water when he opened them the trout was nowhere to be seen tommy looked very crestfallen and foolish as he crawled up on the bank where mother mink was laughing at him how do you expect to catch fish when you splash like that she asked tommy didnt know so he said nothing now you come with me and practise on little fish first she continued and led him to a shallow pool in which a school of minnows were at play now tommy was particularly fond of trout as all mink are and he was inclined to turn up his nose at minnows but he wisely held his tongue and prepared to show that he had learned his lesson this time he slipped into the water quietly and then made a swift dash at the nearest minnow he missed it quite as mother mink had expected he would but now his dander was up he would catch one of those minnows if it took him all the rest of the day three times he tried and missed but the fourth time his sharp little teeth closed on a finny victim and he proudly swam ashore with the fish things you catch yourself always taste best said mother mink now well go over on the meadows and catch some mice tommy scowled i want to catch some more fish said he not the least bit of use for you to try retorted mother mink dont you see that you have frightened those minnows so that they have left the pool besides it is time that you learned to hunt as well as fish and youll find it is just as much fun tommy doubted it but he obediently trotted along at the heels of mother mink out onto the green meadows presently they came to a tiny little path through the meadow grasses mother mink sniffed in it and tommy did the same there was the odor of meadowmouse and once more tommys mouth watered he quite forgot about the fish mother mink darted ahead and presently tommy heard a faint squeak he hurried forward to find mother mink with a fat meadowmouse tommy smacked his lips but she took no notice instead she calmly ate the meadowmouse herself tommy didnt need to be told that if he wanted meadowmouse he would have to catch one for himself with a little angry toss of his head he trotted off along the little path presently he came to another his nose told him a meadowmouse had been along that way recently with his nose to the ground he began to run other little paths branched off from the one he was in tommy paid no attention to them until suddenly he realized that he no longer smelled meadowmouse he kept on a little farther hoping that he would find that entrancing smell again but he didnt so he stopped to consider then he turned and ran back keeping his nose to the ground so he came to one of those little branch paths and there he caught the smell of meadowmouse again he turned into the little branch path and the smell grew stronger he ran faster then his quick ears caught the sound of scurrying feet ahead of him he darted along and there running for his life was a fat meadowmouse half a dozen bounds brought tommy up with him whereupon the mouse turned to fight now the mouse was big and a veteran and tommy was only a youngster it was his first fight for just a second he paused at the sight of the sharp little teeth confronting him then he sprang into his first fight the fierce lust of battle filled him his eyes blazed red there was a short sharp struggle and then the mouse went limp and lifeless very proudly tommy dragged it out to where mother mink was waiting she would have picked it up and carried it easily but tommy wasnt big enough for that after that tommy went hunting or fishing every day sometimes the whole family went and such fun as they would have one day they would hunt frogs around the edge of the smiling pool again they would visit a swamp and dig out worms and insects but best of all they liked to hunt the meadowmice so the long summer wore away and the family kept together but as the cool weather of the fall came tommy grew more and more restless he wanted to see the great world sometimes he would go off and be gone two or three days at a time then one day he bade the old home goodby forever though he didnt know it at the time he simply started off following the laughing brook to the great river in search of adventure and in the joy of exploring new fields he forgot all about home he was a fine big fellow by this time and very smart in the ways of the mink world life was just a grand holiday he hunted or fished when he was hungry and when he was tired he curled up in the nearest hidingplace and slept sometimes it was in a hollow log or stump again it was in an old rockpile or under a heap of brush when he had slept enough he was off again on his travels and it made no difference to him whether it was night or day he just ate when he pleased slept when he pleased and wandered on where and when he pleased he was afraid of no one once in a while a fox would try to catch him or a fierce hawk would swoop at him but tommy would dodge like a flash and laugh as he ducked into some hole or other hidingplace he had learned that quickness of movement often is more than a match for mere size and strength so he was not afraid of any of his neighbors for those he was not strong enough to fight he was clever enough to elude he could run swiftly climb like a squirrel and swim like a fish because he was so slim he could slip into all kinds of interesting holes and dark corners and explore stone and brush piles in fact he could go almost anywhere he pleased his nose was as keen as that of a dog he was always testing the air or sniffing at the ground for the odor of other little people who had passed that way when he was hungry and ran across the trail of some one he fancied he would follow it just as bowser the hound follows the trail of reddy fox sometimes he would follow the trail of reddy himself just to see what he was doing for the most part he kept near water he dearly loved to explore a brook running along beside it swimming the pools investigating every hole in the banks and the piles of drift stuff when he was feeling lazy and there were no fish handy he would catch a frog or two or a couple of pollywogs or a crayfish occasionally he would leave the low land and the water for the high land and hunt rabbits and grouse sometimes he surprised other ground birds once he visited a farmyard and slipping into the henhouse at night killed three fat hens of course he could not eat the whole of even one tommy asked no favors of any one his was a happy carefree life to be sure he had few friends save among his own kind but he didnt mind this he rather enjoyed the fact that all who were smaller and some who were larger than he feared him he was lithe and strong and wonderfully quick fighting was a joy it was this as much as anything that led him into a fight with a big muskrat much bigger than himself the muskrat was stout and his great teeth looked dangerous but he was slow and clumsy in his movements compared with tommy and though he was full of courage and fought hard the battle was not long after that tommy hunted muskrats whenever the notion seized him winter came but tommy minded it not at all his thick fur coat kept him warm and the air was like tonic in his veins it was good to be alive he hunted rabbits in the snow he caught fish at springholes in the ice he traveled long distances under the ice running along the edge of the water where it had fallen away from the frozen crust swimming when he had to investigating muskrat holes and now and then surprising the tenant unlike his small cousin shadow the weasel he seldom hunted and killed just for the fun of killing sometimes when fishing was especially good and he caught more than he could use he would hide them away against a day of need in killing the mink is simply obeying the law of old mother nature for she has given him flesheating teeth and without meat he could not live in this respect he is no worse than man for man kills to live for the most of the time tommy was just a happygolucky traveler who delighted in exploring new places and who saw more of the great world than most of his neighbors the weather never bothered him he liked the sun but he would just as soon travel in the rain when a fierce snowstorm raged he traveled under the ice along the bed of the nearest brook or river it was just the life he had dreamed of as a boy he was an adventurer a freebooter and all the world was his he had no work he had no fear for as yet he had not encountered man hooty the owl by night and certain of the big hawks by day were all he had to watch out for and these he did not really fear for he felt himself too smart for them but at last he did learn fear it came to him when he discovered another mink fast in a trap he didnt understand those strange jaws which bit into the flesh and held and yet were not alive he hid nearby and watched and he saw a great twolegged creature come and take the mink away then cautiously tommy investigated he caught the odor of the man scent and a little chill of fear ran down his backbone but in spite of all his care there came a fateful day he was running along a brook in shallow water when snap from the bottom of the brook itself the dreadful jaws sprang up and caught him by a leg there had been no smell of man to give him warning for the running water had carried it away tommy gave a little shriek as he felt the dreadful thing and thenhe was just tommy sitting on the wishingstone he stared thoughtfully over at the green forest then he shuddered you see he remembered just how he had felt when that trap had snapped on his leg i dont want your fur coat billy mink said he just as if billy could hear him if it wasnt for traps you surely would enjoy life just the same i wouldnt trade places with you not even if i do have to hoe corn just when i want to go swimming and with this tommy started for home and the hoe and somehow the task didnt look so very dreadful after all chapter four tommy becomes a very humble person hello old mr sobersides where are you bound for as he spoke tommy thrust a foot in front of old mr toad and laughed as mr toad hopped up on it and then off quite as if he were accustomed to having big feet thrust in his way not that tommy had especially big feet they simply were big in comparison with mr toad never saw you in a hurry before continued tommy whats it all about you are going as if you were bound for somewhere in particular and as if you had something special on your mind what is it anyway now of course old mr toad didnt make any reply at least he didnt make any that tommy heard if he had tommy wouldnt have understood it the fact is it did look for all the world as if it was just as tommy had said if ever any one had an important engagement to keep and meant to keep it mr toad did if looks counted anything hoppityhophophop hoppityhophophop he went straight down toward the green meadows and he didnt pay any attention to anybody or anything tommy was interested he had known old mr toad ever since he could remember and he couldnt recall ever having seen him go anywhere in particular whenever tommy had noticed him he had seemed to be hopping about in the most aimless sort of way and never took more than a half dozen hops without sitting down to think it over so it was very surprising to see him traveling along in this determined fashion and having nothing better to do tommy decided to follow him and find out what he could so down the lone little path traveled old mr toad hoppityhophophop hoppityhophophop and behind him strolled tommy and while old mr toad seemed to be going very fast and was for him tommy was having hard work to go slow enough to stay behind and this shows what a difference mere size may make when they reached the wishingstone mr toad was tired from having hurried so and tommy was equally tired from the effort of going slow so both were glad to sit down for a rest old mr toad crept in under the edge of the wishingstone on the shady side and tommy still thinking of old mr toad sat down on the wishingstone itself i wonder he chuckled if he has come down here to wish perhaps hell wish himself into something beautiful as they do in fairy stories i should think hed want to goodness knows hes homely enough its bad enough to be freckled but to be covered with wartsugh there isnt a single beautiful thing about him as he said this tommy leaned over that he might better look at old mr toad and mr toad looked up at tommy quite as if he understood what tommy had said so that tommy looked straight into mr toads eyes it was the first time in all his life that tommy had ever looked into a toads eyes whoever would think of looking at the eyes of a hoptoad certainly not tommy eyes were eyes and a toad had two of them wasnt that enough to know why under the sun should a fellow bother about the color of them or anything like that what difference did it make well it made just the difference between knowing and not knowing between knowledge and ignorance between justice and injustice tommy suddenly realized this as he looked straight into the eyes of old mr toad and it gave him a funny feeling inside it was something like that feeling you have when you speak to some one you think is an old friend and find him to be a total stranger ii beg your pardon mr toad said he i take it all back you have something beautifulthe most beautiful eyes ive ever seen if i had eyes as beautiful as yours i wouldnt care how many freckles i had why havent i ever seen them before old mr toad slowly blinked as much as to say thats up to you young man theyre the same two eyes ive always had if you havent learned to use your own eyes that is no fault and no business of mine if i made as little use of my eyes as you do of yours i shouldnt last long it never before had occurred to tommy that there was anything particularly interesting about old mr toad but those beautiful eyesfor a toads eyes are truly beautiful so beautiful that they are the cause of the old legend that a toad carries jewels in his headset him to thinking the more he thought the more he realized how very little he knew about this homely common neighbor of the garden all i know about him is that he eats bugs muttered tommy and on that account is a pretty good fellow to have around my but he has got beautiful eyes i wonder if there is anything else interesting about him i wonder if i should wish to be a toad just to learn about him if i could be one i guess some of the wishes ive made on this old stone have been sort of foolish because every time ive been discontented or envious and i guess the wishes have come true just to teach me a lesson im not discontented now i should say not a fellow would be pretty poor stuff to be discontented on a beautiful spring day like this and i dont envy old mr toad not a bit unless its for his beautiful eyes and i guess that doesnt count i dont see how he can have a very interesting life but i almost want to wish just to see if it will come true at that moment old mr toad came out from under the wishingstone and started on down the lone little path just as before he seemed to be in a hurry to get somewhere and to have something on his mind tommy had to smile as he watched his awkward hops i may as well let him get a good start because he goes so very slow thought tommy and dreamily watched until old mr toad was just going out of sight around a turn in the lone little path then instead of getting up and following tommy suddenly made up his mind to test the old wishingstone i wish said he right out aloud i wish i could be a toad no sooner were the words out of his mouth than he was hurrying down the lone little path after old mr toad hophophoppityhop a toad himself he knew now just where old mr toad was bound for and he was in a hurry a tremendous hurry to get there himself it was the smiling pool he didnt know why he wanted to get there but he did it seemed to him that he couldnt get there quick enough it was spring and the joy of spring made him tingle all over from the tip of his nose to the tips of his toes but with it was a great longinga longing for the smiling pool it was a longing very much like homesickness he felt that he couldnt be really happy until he got there and that nothing could or should keep him away from there he couldnt even stop to eat he knew too that that was just the way old mr toad was feeling and it didnt surprise him as he hurried along hophophoppityhop to find other toads all headed in the same direction and all in just as much of a hurry as he was suddenly he heard a sound that made him hurry faster than ever or at least try to it was a clear sweet peep peep peep its my cousin stickytoes the treetoad and hes got there before me thought tommy and tried to hop faster that single peep grew into a great chorus of peeps and now he heard other voices the voices of his other cousins the frogs he began to feel that he must sing too but he couldnt stop for that at last tommy reached the smiling pool and with a last long hop landed in the shallow water on the edge how good the cool water felt to his dry skin at the very first touch the great longing left tommy and a great content took its place he had reached home and he knew it it was the same way with old mr toad and with the other toads that kept coming and coming from all directions and the very first thing that many of them did as soon as they had rested a bit waswhat do you think why each one began to sing yes sir a great many of those toads began to sing if tommy had been his true self instead of a toad he probably would have been more surprised than he was when he discovered that old mr toad had beautiful eyes but he wasnt surprised now for the very good reason that he was singing himself tommy could no more help singing than he could help breathing just as he had to fill his lungs with air so he had to give expression to the joy that filled him he just had to and as the most natural expression of joy is in song tommy added his voice to the great chorus of the smiling pool in his throat was a pouch for which he had not been aware that he had any particular use now he found out what it was for he filled it with air and it swelled and swelled like a little balloon until it was actually larger than his head and though he wasnt aware of it he filled it in a very interesting way he drew the air in through his nostrils and then forced it through two little slits in the floor of his mouth all the time he kept his mouth tightly closed that little balloon was for the purpose of increasing the sound of his voice later he discovered that he could sing when wholly under water with mouth and nostrils tightly closed by passing the air back and forth between his lungs and that throatpouch it was the same way with all the other toads and on all sides tommy saw them sitting upright in the shallow water with their funny swelledout throats and singing with all their might in all the great world there was no more joyous place than the smiling pool in those beautiful spring days it seemed as if everybody sangredwing the blackbird in the bulrushes little friend the songsparrow in the bushes along the edge of the laughing brook bubbling bob the bobolink in the top of the nearest tree on the green meadows and the toads and frogs in every part of the smiling pool but of all those songs there was none sweeter or more expressive of perfect happiness than that of tommy and his neighbor homely almost uglylooking old mr toad illustration tommy saw them sitting upright in the shallow water but it was not quite true that everybody sang tommy found it out in a way that put an end to his own singing for a little while jolly round bright mr sun was shining his brightest and the singers of the smiling pool were doing their very best when suddenly old mr toad cut his song short right in the middle so did other toads and frogs on both sides of him tommy stopped too just because the others did there was something fearsome in that sudden ending of glad song tommy sat perfectly still with a queer feeling that something dreadful was happening he didnt move but he rolled his eyes this way and that way until he saw something moving on the edge of the shore it was mr blacksnake just starting to crawl away and from his mouth two long legs were feebly kicking one of the sweet singers would sing no more after that no matter how glad and happy he felt as he sang he kept a sharp watch all the time for mr snake for he had learned that there was danger even in the midst of joy but when the dusk of evening came he knew that mr snake was no longer to be feared and he sang in perfect peace and contentment until there came an evening when again that mighty chorus stopped abruptly a shadow passed over him looking up he saw a great bird with soundless wings and hanging from its claws one of the sweet singers whose voice was stilled forever hooty the owl had caught his supper so tommy learned that not all folk sing their joy in spring and that those who do not such as mr blacksnake and hooty the owl were to be watched out for too bad too bad whispered old mr toad as they waited for some one to start the chorus again that fellow was careless he didnt watch out he forgot bad business forgetting bad business doesnt do at all now ive lived a great many years and i expect to live a great many more i never forget to watch out we toads havent very many enemies and if we watch out for the few we have there isnt much to worry about its safe to start that chorus again so here goes he swelled his throat out and began to sing in five minutes it was as if nothing had happened at the smiling pool so the glad spring passed and tommy saw many things of interest he saw thousands of tiny eggs hatch into funny little tadpoles and for a while it was hard to tell at first glance the toad tadpoles from their cousins the frog tadpoles but the little toad babies grew fast and it was almost no time at all before they were not tadpoles at all but tiny little toads with tails day by day the tails grew shorter until there were no tails at all each baby a perfect little toad no bigger than a goodsized cricket but big enough to consider that he had outgrown his nursery and to be eager to leave the smiling pool and go out into the great world foolish foolish much better off here got a lot to learn before they can take care of themselves in the great world grumbled old mr toad then he chuckled know just how they feel though said he felt the same way myself at their age suppose you did too of course tommy never having been little like that for he had wished himself into a fullgrown toad had no such memory but old mr toad didnt seem to expect a reply for he went right on took care of myself and i guess those little rascals can do the same thing by the way this water is getting uncomfortably warm besides ive got business to attend to cant sing all the time holidays are over think ill start along back tonight are you going my way now tommy hadnt thought anything about the matter he had noticed that a great many toads were leaving the smiling pool and that he himself didnt care so much about singing then too he longed for a good meal for he had eaten little since coming to the smiling pool so when old mr toad asked if he was going his way tommy suddenly decided that he was good replied old mr toad well start as soon as it begins to grow dark its safer then besides i never could travel in bright hot weather its bad for the health so when the black shadows began to creep across the green meadows old mr toad and tommy turned their backs on the smiling pool and started up the lone little path they were not in a hurry now as they had been when they came down the lone little path and they hopped along slowly stopping to hunt bugs and slugs and worms for they were very very hungry old mr toad fixed his eyes on a fly which had just lighted on the ground two inches in front of him he sat perfectly still but there was a lightninglike flash of something pink from his mouth and the fly was gone mr toad smacked his lips i dont see how some people get along with their tongues fastened way back in their throats he remarked the proper place for a tongue to be fastened is the way ours areby the front end then you can shoot it out its whole length and get your meal every time see that spider over there if i tried to get any nearer hed be gone at the first move hes a goner anyway watch there was that little pink flash again and sure enough the spider had disappeared once more old mr toad smacked his lips didnt i tell you he was a goner said he chuckling over his own joke tommy quite agreed with old mr toad that arrangement of his tongue certainly was most convenient any insect he liked to eat that came within two inches of his nose was as good as caught all he had to do was to shoot out his tongue which was sticky and when he drew it back it brought the bug with it and carried it well down his throat to a comfortable point to swallow yes it certainly was convenient it took so much time to fill their stomachs that they did not travel far that night the next day they spent under an old barrel where they buried themselves in the soft earth by digging holes with their stout hind feet and backing in at the same time until just their noses and eyes showed at the doorways ready to snap up any foolish bugs or worms who might seek shelter in their hidingplace it was such a comfortable place that they stayed several days going out nights to hunt and returning at daylight it was while they were there that old mr toad complained that his skin was getting too tight and uncomfortable and announced that he was going to change it and he did it was a pretty tiresome process and required a lot of wriggling and kicking but little by little the old skin split in places and mr toad worked it off getting his hind legs free first and later his hands using the latter to pull the last of it from the top of his head over his eyes and as fast as he worked it loose he swallowed it now i feel better said he as with a final gulp he swallowed the last of his old suit tommy wasnt sure that he looked any better for the new skin looked very much like the old one but he didnt say so tommy found that he needed four good meals a day and filling his stomach took most of his time when he wasnt resting cutworms he found especially to his liking and it was astonishing how many he could eat in a night caterpillars of many kinds helped out and it was great fun to sit beside an anthill and snap up the busy workers as they came out but besides their daily foraging there was plenty of excitement as when a rustling warned them that a snake was near or a shadow on the grass told them that a hawk was sailing overhead at those times they simply sat perfectly still and looked so much like little lumps of earth that they were not seen at all or if they were they were not recognized instead of drinking they soaked water in through the skin to have a dry skin was to be terribly uncomfortable and that is why they always sought shelter during the sunny hours at last came a rainy day toad weather perfect toad weather exclaimed old mr toad this is the day to travel illustration toad weather perfect toad weather exclaimed old mr toad so once more they took up their journey in a leisurely way a little past noon the clouds cleared away and the sun came out bright time to get under cover grunted old mr toad and led the way to a great gray rock beside the lone little path and crawled under the edge of it tommy was just going to followwhen something happened he wasnt a toad at alljust a frecklefaced boy sitting on the wishingstone he pinched himself to make sure then he looked under the edge of the wishingstone for old mr toad he wasnt there gradually he remembered that he had seen old mr toad disappearing around a turn in the lone little path going hoppityhophophop as if he had something on his mind and i thought that there was nothing interesting about a toad muttered tommy i wonder if its all true i believe ill run down to the smiling pool and just see if that is where mr toad really was going he must have about reached there by this time he jumped to his feet and ran down the lone little path as he drew near the smiling pool he stopped to listen to the joyous chorus rising from it he had always thought of the singers as just peepers or frogs now for the first time he noticed that there were different voices just ahead of him he saw something moving it was old mr toad softly very softly tommy followed and saw him jump into the shallow water carefully he tiptoed nearer and watched presently old mr toads throat began to swell and swell until it was bigger than his head then he began to sing it was only a couple of notes tremulous and wonderfully sweet and so expressive of joy and gladness that tommy felt his own heart swell with happiness it is true he cried and all the rest must be true and i said there was nothing beautiful about a toad when all the time he has the most wonderful eyes and the sweetest voice ive ever heard it must be true about that queer tongue and the way he sheds his skin im going to watch and see for myself why ive known old mr toad all my life and thought him just a common fellow when all the time he is just wonderful im glad ive been a toad of course there is nothing like being a boy but id rather be a toad than some other things ive been on the old wishingstone im going to get all the toads i can to live in my garden this summer and that is just what tommy did with the result that he had one of the best gardens anywhere around and nobody knew why but tommyand his friends the toads tommy had no intention of doing any more wishing on that old stone but he did he just couldnt keep away from it if you want to know what his wishes were and what more he learned you will find it in the next volume tommys wishes come true tommys wishes come true tommys wishes come true chapter one why peter rabbit has one less enemy peter rabbit was happy there was no question about that you had only to watch him a few minutes to know it he couldnt hide that happiness any more than the sun at midday can hide when there are no clouds in the sky happiness seemed to fairly shoot from his long heels as they twinkled merrily this way and that way through the dear old briarpatch peter was doing crazy things he was so happy that he was foolish happiness you know is the only excuse for foolishness and peter was foolish very very foolish he would suddenly jump into the air kick his long heels dart off to one side change his mind and dart the other way run in a circle and then abruptly plump himself down under a bush and sit as still as if he couldnt move then without any warning at all he would cut up some other funny antic he was so foolish and so funny that finally tommy who unseen by peter was watching him laughed aloud perhaps peter doesnt like being laughed at most people dont it may be peter was a little bit uncertain as to why he was being laughed at anyway with a sudden thump of his stout hindfeet he scampered out of sight along one of his private little paths which led into the very thickest tangle in the dear old briarpatch ill have to come over here with my gun and get that rabbit for my dinner said tommy as he trudged homeward probably though if i have a gun i wont see him at all its funny how a fellow is forever seeing things when he hasnt got a gun and when he goes hunting he never sees anything tommy had come to the great gray stone which was his favorite restingplace he sat down from sheer force of habit somehow he never could get past that stone without sitting on it for a few minutes it seemed to just beg to be sat on he was still thinking of peter rabbit i wonder what made him feel so frisky thought tommy then he laughed aloud once more as he remembered how comical peter had looked it must be fun to feel as happy as all that without once thinking of where he was tommy exclaimed aloud i declare i wish i were a rabbit he was his wish had come true just as quick as that he found himself a rabbit you see he had been sitting on the wishingstone if he had remembered perhaps he wouldnt have wished but he had forgotten and now here he was looking as if he might very well be own brother to peter rabbit not only did he look like peter but he felt like him anyway he felt a crazy impulse to run and jump and do foolish things and he did them he just couldnt help doing them it was his way of showing how good he felt just as shouting is a boys way and singing is the way of a bird but in the very midst of one of his wildest whirls he heard a sound that brought him up short as still as a stone it was the sound of a heavy thump and it came from the direction of the old briarpatch tommy didnt need to be told that it was a signal a signal from peter rabbit to all other rabbits within hearing distance he didnt know just the meaning of that signal and because he didnt he just sat still now it happens that that was exactly what that signal meantto sit tight and not move peter had seen something that to him looked very suspicious so on general principles he had signaled and then had himself sat perfectly still until he should discover if there was any real danger tommy didnt know this but being a rabbit now he felt as a rabbit feels and from the second he heard that thump he was as frightened as he had been happy a minute before and being frightened yet not knowing of what he was afraid he sat absolutely still listening with all his might and looking this way and that as best he could without moving his head and all the time he worked his nose up and down up and down as all rabbits do and tested the air for strange smells presently tommy heard behind him a sound that filled him with terrible fear it was a loud sniff sniff rolling his eyes back so that he could look behind without turning his head he saw a dog sniffing and snuffing in the grass now that dog wasnt very big as dogs go but he was so much bigger than even the largest rabbit that to tommy he looked like a giant the terrible fear that filled him clutched at tommys heart until it seemed as if it would stop beating what should he do sit still or run somehow he was afraid to do either just then the matter was settled for him thump thump thump the signal came along the ground from the old briarpatch and almost any one would have known just by the short sharp sound that those thumps meant run at just the same instant the dog caught the scent of tommy full and strong with a roar of his great voice he sprang forward his nose in tommys tracks tommy waited no longer with a great bound he leaped forward in the direction of the old briarpatch how he did run a dozen bounds brought him to the old briarpatch and there just before him was a tiny path under the brambles he didnt stop to question how it came there or who had made it he dodged in and scurried along it to the very middle of the old briarpatch then he stopped to listen and look the dog had just reached the edge of the briars he knew where tommy had gone of course he knew his nose told him that he thrust his head in at the entrance to the little path and tried to crawl in but the sly old brambles tore his long tender ears and he yelped with pain now instead of with the excitement of the chase then he backed out whining and yelping he ran around the edge of the old briarpatch looking for some place where he could get in more comfortably but there was no place and after a while he gave up and went off tommy sat right where he was until he was quite sure that the dog had gone when he was quite sure he started to explore the dear old briarpatch for he was very curious to see what it was like in there he found little paths leading in all directions some of them led right through the very thickest tangles of ugly looking brambles and tommy found that he could run along these with never a fear of a single scratch and as he hopped along he knew that here he was safe absolutely safe from most of his enemies for no one bigger than he could possibly get through those briars without being terribly scratched so it was with a very comfortable feeling that tommy peered out through the brambles and watched that annoying dog trot off in disgust he felt that never so long as he was within running distance of the dear old briarpatch would he be afraid of a dog right into the midst of his pleasant thoughts broke a rude thump thump thump it wasnt a dangersignal this time that is it didnt mean run for your life tommy was very sure of that and yet it might be a kind of dangersignal too it all depended on what tommy decided to do there it was againthump thump thump it had an ugly threatening sound tommy knew just as well as if there had been spoken words instead of mere thumps on the ground that he was being warned to get out of the old briarpatchthat he had no right there because it belonged to some one else but tommy had no intention of leaving such a fine place such a beautifully safe place unless he had to and no mere thumps on the ground could make him believe that he could thump himself he did those long hindfeet of his were just made for thumping when he hit the ground with them he did it with a will and the thumps he made sounded just as ugly and threatening as the other fellows and he knew that the other fellow knew exactly what they meantill do as i please put me out if you can it was very clear that this was just what the other proposed to do if his thumps meant anything at all presently tommy saw a trim neatlooking rabbit in a little open space and it was something of a relief to find that he was about tommys own size if i cant whip him he certainly cant whip me thought tommy and straightway thumped im coming in reply to the strangers angry demand that he come out and fight now the stranger was none other than peter rabbit and he was very indignant he considered that he owned the dear old briarpatch he was perfectly willing that any other rabbit should find safety there in time of danger but when the danger was past they must get out tommy hadnt therefore he must be driven out now if tommy had been himself instead of a rabbit never never would he have dreamed of fighting as he was preparing to fight nowby biting and kicking particularly kicking but for a rabbit kicking was quite the correct and proper thing in fact it was the only way to fight so instead of coming together headon tommy and peter approached each other in queer little halfsidewise rushes each watching for a chance to use his stout hindfeet suddenly peter rushed jumped andwell when tommy picked himself up he felt very much as a boy feels when he has been tackled and thrown in a football game certainly peters hindlegs were in good working order just a minute later tommys chance came and peter was sent sprawling like a flash tommy was after him biting and pulling out little bunches of soft fur so they fought until at last they were so out of wind and so tired that there was no fight left in either then they lay and panted for breath and quite suddenly they forgot their quarrel each knew that he couldnt whip the other and that being so what was the use of fighting i suppose this old briarpatch is big enough for both of us said peter after a little ill live on one side and you live on the other replied tommy and so it was agreed in three things tommy found that as a rabbit he was not unlike tommy the boy these three were appetite curiosity and a decided preference for pleasure rather than work tommy felt as if he lived to eat instead of eating to live he wanted to eat most of the time it seemed as if he never could get his stomach really full there was one satisfaction and that was that he never had to look very far for something to eat there were clover and grass just outside the briarpatchall he wanted for the taking there were certain tenderleaved plants for a change not to mention tender bark from young trees and bushes with peter he made occasional visits to a not too distant garden where they fairly reveled in goodies illustration with peter he made visits to a garden these visits were in the nature of adventure it seemed to tommy that not even danny meadowmouse had so many enemies as he and peter had they used to talk it over sometimes it isnt fair said peter in a grieved tone we dont hurt anybody we dont do the least bit of harm to any one and yet it isnt safe for us to play two minutes outside the dear old briarpatch without keeping watch no sir it isnt fair theres redtail the hawk watching this very minute from way up there in the sky he looks as if he were just sailing round and round for the fun of it but he isnt hes just watching for you or me to get one too many jumps away from these old briars then down hell come like a shot now what harm have we ever done redtail or any of his family tell me that of course tommy couldnt tell him that and so peter went on when i was a baby i came very near to finding out just how far it is from mr blacksnakes mouth to his stomach by the inside passage and all that saved me was the interference of a boy who set me free now that im grown im not afraid of mr blacksnakethough i keep out of his waybut i have to keep on the watch all the time for that boy the same one asked tommy the very same replied peter hes forever setting his dog after me and trying to get a shot at me with his terrible gun yet ive never done him any harmnor the dog either its very curious said tommy not knowing what else to say it seems to me there ought to be some time when it is reasonably safe for an honest rabbit to go abroad continued peter who now that he was started seemed bound to make the worst of his troubles at night i cannot even dance in the moonlight without all the time looking one way for reddy fox and another for hooty the owl its a good thing that the briarpatch is always safe said tommy because he could think of nothing else to say but it isnt snapped peter i wish to goodness it was now thereslisten peter sat very still with his ears pricked forward something very like a look of fear grew and grew in his eyes tommy sat quite as still and listened with all his might presently he heard a faint rustling it sounded as if it was in one of the little paths through the briarpatch yes it surely was and it was drawing nearer tommy gathered himself together for instant flight and a strange fear gripped his heart its billy mink gasped peter if he follows you dont run into a hole in the ground or into a hollow log whatever you do keep going hell get tired after a while there he isrun peter bounded off one way and tommy another after a few jumps tommy squatted to make sure whether or not he was being followed he saw a slim dark form slipping through the brambles and he knew that billy mink was following peter tommy couldnt help a tiny sigh of relief he was sorry for peter but peter knew every path and twist and turn while he didnt it was a great deal better that peter should be the one to try to fool billy mink so tommy sat perfectly still and watched he saw peter twist and turn run in a circle crisscross run back on his own trail and make a break by leaping far to one side he saw billy mink follow every twist and turn his nose in peters tracks when he reached the place where peter had broken the trail he ran in ever widening circles until he picked it up again and once more peter was on the run tommy felt little cold shivers chase up and down his back as he watched how surely and persistently billy mink followed and thenhe hardly knew how it happenedpeter had jumped right over him and there was billy mink coming there was nothing to do but run and tommy ran he doubled and twisted and played all the tricks he had seen peter play and then at last when he was beginning to get quite tired he played the same trick on peter that had seemed so dreadful when peter played it on him he led billy mink straight to where peter was sitting and once more peter was the hunted but billy mink was getting tired after a little he gave up and went in quest of something more easily caught peter came back to where tommy was sitting billy minks a tough customer to get rid of alone but with some one to change off with it is no trick at all said he it wouldnt work so well with his cousin shadow the weasel hes the one i am afraid of i think we should be safer if we had some new paths what do you think tommy confessed that he thought so too it would have been very much easier to have dodged billy mink if there had been a few more cross paths we better make them before we need them more than we did this time said peter and as this was just plain sound rabbit common sense tommy was forced to agree and so it was that he learned that a rabbit must work if he would live long and be happy he didnt think of it in just this way as he patiently cut paths through the brambles and tangles of bush and vine it was fear just plain fear that was driving him and even this drove him to work only by spells between times when he wasnt eating he sat squatting under a bush just lazily dreaming but always ready to run for his life in the moonlight he and peter loved to gambol and play in some open space where there was room to jump and dance but even in the midst of these joyous times they must need sit up every minute or so to stop look and listen for danger it was at night too that they wandered farthest from the old briarpatch once they met bobby coon and peter warned tommy never to allow bobby to get him cornered and once they met jimmy skunk who paid no attention to them at all but went right on about his business it was hard to believe that he was another to be warned against but so peter said and peter ought to know if anybody did so tommy learned to be ever on the watch he learned to take note of his neighbors he could tell by the sound of his voice when sammy jay was watching reddy fox and when he saw a hunter when blacky the crow was on guard he knew that he was reasonably safe from surprise at least once a day but more often several times a day he had a narrow escape but he grew used to it and as soon as a fright was over he forgot it it was the only way to do as he learned more and more how to watch and to care for himself he grew bolder curiosity led him farther and farther from the briarpatch and then one day he discovered that reddy fox was between him and it there was nothing to do but to run and twist and double and dodge every trick he had learned he tried in vain he was in the open and reddy was too wise to be fooled illustration reddy fox was between him and his castle he was right at tommys heels now and with every jump tommy expected to feel those cruel white teeth just ahead was a great rock if he could reach that perhaps there might be a crack in it big enough for a frightened little rabbit to squeeze into or a hole under it where he might find safety he was almost up to it would he be able to make it one jump he could hear reddy panting two jumps he could feel reddys breath three jumps he was on the rock andslowly tommy rubbed his eyes reddy fox was nowhere to be seen of course not no fox would be foolish enough to come near a boy sitting in plain sight tommy looked over to the old briarpatch that at least was real slowly he walked over to it peering under the bushes he saw peter rabbit squatting perfectly still yet ready to run you dont need to peter said he you dont need to you can cut one boy off that long list of enemies you are always watching for you see i know just how you feel peter he walked around to the other side of the briarpatch and stooping down thumped the ground once with his hand there was an answering thump from the spot where he had seen peter rabbit tommy smiled were friends peter said he and its all on account of the wishingstone ill never hunt you again my i wouldnt be a rabbit for anything in the world being a boy is good enough for me chapter two why tommy became a friend of red squirrels i dont see what sis wants to string this stuff all over the house for just because it happens to be christmas grumbled tommy as he sat on a big stone and idly kicked at a pile of beautiful groundpine and fragrant balsam boughs its the best day for skating weve had yet and here i am missing a whole morning of it and so tired that most likely i wont feel like going this afternoon now tommy knew perfectly well that if his mother said that he could go nothing could keep him away from the pond that afternoon he was a little tired perhaps but not nearly so tired as he tried to think he was gathering christmas greens was work of course but when you come right down to it there is work about almost everything even skating the chief difference between work and pleasure is the difference between must and want to when you must do a thing it becomes work when you want to do a thing it becomes pleasure right down deep inside where his honest self lives tommy was glad that there was going to be a green wreath in each of the front windows and that over the doors and pictures there would be sweetsmelling balsam without them why christmas wouldnt be christmasy at all and really it had been fun gathering those greens he wouldnt admit it but it had he wouldnt have missed it for the world it was only that it had to be done just when he wanted to do something else and so he tried to feel grieved and persecuted and to forget that christmas was only two days off he sat on the big gray stone and looked across the green meadows no longer green but covered with the whitest and lightest of snowblankets across the old pasture not one whit less beautiful to the green forest and he sighed it was a deep heavy sigh it was the sigh of a selfmade martyr as if in reply he heard the sharp voice of chatterer the red squirrel it rang out clear and loud on the frosty air and it was very plain that whatever troubles others might have chatterer was very well satisfied with the world in general and himself in particular just now he was racing along the fence stopping at every post to sit up and tell all the world that he was there and didnt care who knew it presently his sharp eyes spied tommy chatterer stopped short in the middle of a rail and looked at tommy very hard then he barked at him jerking his tail with every syllable tommy didnt move chatterer jumped down from the fence and came nearer every foot or so he paused and barked and his bark was such a funny mixture of nervousness and excitement and curiosity and sauciness not to say impudence that finally tommy laughed right out he just couldnt help it back to the fence rushed chatterer and scampered up to the top of a post once sure of the safety of this retreat he faced tommy and began to scold as fast as his tongue could go of course tommy couldnt understand what chatterer was saying but he could guess he was telling tommy just what he thought of a boy who would sit moping on such a beautiful day and only two days before christmas at that my how his tongue did fly when he had had his say to the full he gave a final whisk of his tail and scampered off in the direction of the old orchard and as he went it seemed to tommy as if he looked back with the sauciest kind of a twinkle in his eyes as much as to say you deserve all ive said but i dont really mean it tommy watched him a lively little red spot against the white background and as he watched the smile gradually faded away it never would do at all to go home in good spirits after raising such a fuss as he had when he started out so to make himself feel as badly as he felt that he ought to feel tommy sighed dolefully oh but youre lucky said he as chatterers sharp voice floated over to him from the old orchard you dont have to do a blessed thing unless you want to all you have to do is to eat and sleep and have a good time it must be fun i wish i were a squirrel right then something happened it happened all in a flash just as it had happened to tommy before one minute he was a boy a discontented boy sitting on a big gray stone on the edge of the green meadows and the next minute he wasnt a boy at all you see when he made that wish he had quite forgotten that he was sitting on the wishingstone now he no longer had to guess at what chatterer was saying not a bit of it he knew he talked the same language himself in short he was a red squirrel and in two minutes had forgotten that he ever had been a boy how good it felt to be free and know that he could do just as he pleased his first impulse was to race over to the old orchard and make the acquaintance of chatterer then he thought better of it something inside him seemed to tell him that he had no business therethat the old orchard was not big enough for two red squirrels and that as chatterer had gone there first it really belonged to him in a way he felt quite sure of it when he had replied to chatterers sharp voice and had been told in no uncertain tones that the best thing he could do would be to run right back where he had come from of course he couldnt do that so he decided to do the next best thingrun over to the green forest and see what there was to do there he hopped up on the rail fence and whisked along the top rail what fun it was he didnt have a care in the world all he had to do was to eat drink and have a good time ha who was that coming along behind him was it chatterer it looked something like him yet different somehow tommy sat quite still watching the stranger and as he watched a curious terror began to creep over him the stranger wasnt chatterer no indeed he wasnt even a squirrel he was too long and slim and his tail was different he was shadow the weasel tommy didnt have to be told that although he never had seen shadow before he knew without being told for a minute he couldnt move then his heart beating with fear until it seemed as if it would burst he fled along the fence toward the green forest and now he didnt stop at the posts when he came to them his one thought was to get away away as far as ever he could for in the eyes of shadow the weasel he had seen death up the nearest tree he raced and hid clinging close to the trunk near the top staring down with eyes fairly bulging with fright swiftly yet without seeming to hurry shadow the weasel came straight to the tree in which tommy was hiding his nose in tommys tracks in the way that a hound follows a rabbit or a fox at the foot of the tree he stopped just a second and looked up then he began to climb at the first scratch of his claws on the bark tommy raced out along a branch and leaped across to the next tree then in a great panic he went on from tree to tree taking desperate chances in his long leaps in the whole of his little being he had room for but one feeling and that was fearfear of that savage pitiless pursuer he had run a long way before he realized that he was no longer being followed the fact is shadow had found other game easier to catch and had given up now just as soon as tommy realized that shadow the weasel was no longer on his track he straightway forgot his fear in fact it was just as if he never had had a fright for that is the law of mother nature with her little people of the wild so presently tommy was once more as happy and carefree as before in a big chestnuttree just ahead of him he could see happy jack the gray squirrel and happy jack was very busy about something perhaps he had a storehouse there the very thought made tommy hungry once more he hid but this time not in fear he hid so that he could watch happy jack not a sound did he make as he peered out from his hidingplace happy jack was a long time in that hollow limb it seemed as if he never would come out so tommy started on to look for more mischief for he was bubbling over with good spirits and felt that he must do something presently quite by accident he discovered another hoard of nuts mostly acorns neatly tucked away in a crotch of a big tree of course he sampled them what fun thought he i dont know who they belong to and i dont care from now on they are going to belong to me he started to carry them away but a sudden harsh scream close to him startled him so that he dropped the nut he had in his mouth he dodged behind the trunk of the tree just in time to escape the dash of an angry bird in a brilliant blue suit with white and black trimmings illustration a sudden harsh scream startled him so that he dropped the nut thief thief thief leave my acorns alone screamed sammy jay anger making his voice harsher than ever round and round the trunk of the tree tommy dodged chattering back in reply to the sharp tongue of the angry bird it was exciting without being very dangerous after a while however it grew tiresome and watching his chance he slipped over to another tree and into a hole made by drummer the woodpecker sammy jay didnt see where he had disappeared and after hunting in vain gave up and began to carry his acorns away to a new hidingplace tommys eyes sparkled with mischief as he watched by and by he would have a hunt for it it would be fun when sammy jay had hidden the last acorn and flown away tommy came out he didnt feel like hunting for those acorns just then so he scampered up in a tall hemlocktree and just out of sheer good spirits and because he could see no danger near he called sharply that all within hearing might know that he was about almost instantly he received a reply from not far away it was an angry warning to keep away from that part of the green forest because he had no business there it was the voice of chatterer tommy replied just as angrily that he would stay if he wanted to then they barked and chattered at each other for a long time gradually chatterer came nearer finally he was in the very next tree he stopped there long enough to tell tommy all that he would do to him when he caught him and at the end he jumped across to tommys tree tommy waited no longer he wasnt ready to fight in the first place he knew that chatterer probably had lived there a long time and so was partly right in saying that tommy had no business there then chatterer looked a little the bigger and stronger so tommy nimbly ran out on a branch and leaped across to the next tree in a flash chatterer was after him and then began a most exciting race through the treetops tommy found that there were regular squirrel highways through the treetops and along these he raced at top speed chatterer at his heels scolding and threatening when he reached the edge of the green forest tommy darted down the last tree across the open space to the old stone wall and along this chatterer following suddenly the anger in chatterers voice changed to a sharp cry of warning tommy scrambled into a crevice between two stones without stopping to inquire what the trouble was when he peeped out he saw a great bird sailing back and forth in a few minutes it alighted on a nearby tree and sat there so still that if tommy had not seen it alight he never would have known it was there mr goshawk nearly got you that time said a voice very near at hand tommy turned to find chatterer peeping out from another crevice in the old wall it wont be safe for us to show ourselves until he leaves continued chatterer its getting so that an honest squirrel needs eyes in the back of his head to keep his skin whole not to mention living out his natural life hello here comes a boy and that means more trouble theres one good thing about it and that is hell frighten away that hawk tommy looked and sure enough there was a boy and in his hands was an airrifle tommy didnt know what it was but chatterer did i wish that hawk would hurry up and fly so that we can run he sputtered the thing that boy carries throws things and they hurt it isnt best to let him get too near when he has that with him he seems to think its fun to hurt us id just like to bite him once and see if he thought that was fun there goes that hawk come on now weve got to run for it chatterer led the way and tommy followed he was frightened but there wasnt that terror which had possessed him when shadow the weasel was after him something struck sharply against the wall just behind him it frightened him into greater speed something struck just in front of him and then something hit him so hard that just for a second he nearly lost his balance it hurt dreadfully hurrah shouted the boy i hit him that time then the boy started to run after them so as to get a closer shot well get up in the top of that big hemlocktree and he wont be able to see us panted chatterer did he hit you thats too bad it might have been worse though if he had had one of those things that make a big noise and smoke we might not either of us be here now boys are hateful things i dont see what fun they get out of frightening and hurting such little folks as you and me theyre brutes thats what they are when we get across that little open place we can laugh at him come on now down from the end of the old wall chatterer jumped and raced across to the foot of a big hemlocktree tommy at his heels up the tree they ran and hid close to the trunk where the branches were thick they could peer down and see the boy but he couldnt see them he walked around the tree two or three times and then shot up into the top to try to frighten the squirrels dont move whispered chatterer he doesnt see us tommy obeyed although he felt as if he must run his heart seemed to jump every time a bullet spatted in among the branches it was dreadful to sit there and do nothing while being shot at and not know but that the very next minute one of those little lead shot would hit tommy knew just how it would hurt if it did hit presently the boy gave up and went off to torment some one else no sooner was his back fairly turned than chatterer began to scold and jeer at him tommy joined him it was just as if there never had been any danger if that boy could have understood what they said his ears would have burned then chatterer showed tommy just what part of the green forest he claimed as his own and also showed him a part that had belonged to another squirrel to whom something had happened and suggested that tommy take that for his it wasnt as good as chatterers but still it would do very well tommy took possession at once each agreed not to intrude on the others territory on common ground that didnt belong to either of them they would be the best of friends but tommy knew that if he went into chatterers part of the green forest he would have to fight and he made up his mind that if any other squirrel came into his part of the green forest there would be a fight suddenly he was very jealous of his new possession he was hardly willing to leave it when chatterer suggested a visit to a nearby corncrib for a feast of yellow corn chatterer led the way tommy found that he was quite lame from the shot which had hit him but he was soon racing after chatterer again along the old stone wall then along a fence up a mapletree and from there to the roof of the corncrib they scampered chatterer knew just where to get inside and in a few minutes they were stuffing themselves with yellow corn when they had eaten all that they could hold they stuffed their cheeks full and started back the way they had come tommy went straight to his own part of the green forest and there he hid his treasure some in a hollow stump and some under a little pile of leaves between the roots of a tree all the time he watched sharply to make sure that no one saw him while looking for new hidingplaces his nose told him to dig there buried under the leaves he found nuts hidden by the one who had lived there before him there must be many more hidden there and it would be great fun hunting for them doubtless he would find as many as if he had hidden them himself for he had seen that chatterer didnt know where he had put a tenth part of the things he had hidden he just trusted to his nose to help him get them again he found a splendid nest made of leaves and strips of inner bark in the hollow stub of a big branch of a chestnuttree and he made up his mind that there was where he would sleep then he ran over to see chatterer again he found him scolding at a cat who watched him with yellow unblinking eyes chatterer would run down the trunk of the tree almost to the ground and there scold and call names as fast as his tongue could go then he would run back up to the lowest branch and scold from there the next time he would go a little farther down finally he leaped to the ground and raced across to another tree the cat sprang but was just too late chatterer jeered at her then he began the same thing over again and kept at it until finally the cat gave up and left in disgust it had been exciting but tommy shivered at the thought of what might have happened ever try that with a fox asked chatterer no replied tommy i have boasted chatterer but ive seen squirrels caught doing it he said still i suppose one may as well be caught by a fox as by a hawk did you see that weasel this morning asked tommy chatterer actually shivered as he replied yes i saw him after you its a wonder he didnt get you youre lucky i was lucky myself this morning for a mink went right past where i was hiding life is nothing but one jump after another these days it seems as if when one has worked as hard as i did last fall to store up enough food to keep me all winter i ought to be allowed to enjoy it in comfort those who sleep all winter like johnny chuck have a mighty easy time of it they dont know when they are well off still id hate to miss all the excitement and fun of life i would rather jump for my life twenty times a day as i have to and know that im alive than to be alive and not know it see that dog down there i hate dogs im going to tell him so off raced chatterer to bark and scold at a little blackandwhite dog which paid no attention to him at all the shadows were creeping through the trees and tommy began to think of his nest he looked once more at chatterer who was racing along the top of the old wall scolding at the dog suddenly what seemed like merely a darker shadow swept over chatterer and when it had passed he had vanished for once that fatal once he had been careless hooty the owl had caught him tommy shivered he was frightened and cold he would get to his nest as quickly as he could he leaped down to a great gray stone andbehold he wasnt a squirrel at all he was just a boy sitting on a big stone with a heap of christmas greens at his feet he shivered for he was cold then he jumped up and stamped his feet and threshed his arms a million diamond points glittered in the white meadows where the snow crystals splintered the sunbeams from the old orchard sounded the sharp scolding chirr and cough of chatterer the red squirrel tommy listened and slowly a smile widened hooty didnt get you after all he muttered then in a minute he added im glad of it and you havent anything more to fear from me you wont believe it but you havent you may be mischievous but i guess you have troubles enough without me adding to them oh but im glad im not a squirrel being a boys good enough for me specially long bout christmas time i guess sis will be tickled with these greens but its queer what happens when i sit down on this old rock he frowned at it as if he couldnt understand it at all then he gathered up his load of greens and with the merriest of whistles trudged homeward and to this day chatterer the red squirrel cannot understand how it came about that from that christmas he and tommy became fast friends but they did perhaps the wishingstone could tell if it would chapter three the pleasures and troubles of bobby coon tommy was trudging down to the cornfield and his freckled face was rather sober at least it was sober for him considering why he was on his way to the cornfield it wasnt to work if it had been his sober look would have been quite easy to understand the fact is tommy was going on an errand that once would have filled him with joy and sent him whistling all the way coons are raising mischief down in the corn youd better get your traps out and see if you can catch the thieving little rascals go down and look the ground over and see what you think his father had said to him at noon that day so here he was on his way to look for signs of bobby coon and if the truth were known actually hoping that he wouldnt find them there had been a time when he would have been all excitement over his quest and eager to find the telltale tracks where bobby coon went into and out of the cornfield then he would have hurried home for his traps in great glee or instead would have planned to watch with his gun for bobby that very night but now he had no such feelings somehow he had come to regard his little wild neighbors in a wholly different light he no longer desired to do them harm ever since he had begun to learn what their real lives were like by wishing himself one of them as he sat on the old wishingstone he had cared less and less to hunt and frighten them and more and more to try to make friends with them his teacher would have said that he had a sympathetic understanding of them and then probably would have had to explain to tommy what that meantthat he knew just how they felt and had learned to look at things from their point of view and it was true he had put away his gun and traps he no longer desired to kill he liked to hunt for these little wild people as much as ever perhaps more but it was in order to make friends with them and to find out more about their ways and habits instead of to kill them so it was that he didnt like his present errand on the brow of the hill that overlooked the cornfield he stopped for a minute to look down on the broad acres of longleaved stalks standing row on row row on row like a well drilled army he thought of the long hours he had spent among them toiling with his hoe in the hot sunshine when the swimminghole was calling to him and a sudden sense of pride swept over him the great sturdy plants no longer needed his hoe to keep the weeds down the ears had filled out and were in the milk now seems as if we could spare what little a coon wants muttered tommy as he gazed down on the field of course if there is a whole family of em somethings got to be done but i dont believe one coon can eat enough to do much harm dad promised me a share in the crop when its harvested to pay for my work it isnt likely to be very much and goodness knows i want every penny of it but i guess if that coon isnt doing too much damage i can pay for it tommys face lighted up at the idea it was going to take selfdenial on his part but it was a way out the thought chased the soberness from his face and put a spring into his hitherto reluctant steps he went at once to that part of the cornfield nearest the green forest it did not take him long to discover the evidences that a raccoon or perhaps more than one had been taking toll here a stalk less sturdy than its neighbors had been pulled down the husks stripped from the ears and a few mouthfuls of the milky grains taken there a stalk had been climbed and an ear stripped and bitten into wasteful little beggar muttered tommy why cant you be content to take an ear at a time and clean it up then there would be no kick coming dad wouldnt mind if you filled your little tummy every night if you didnt spoil ten times as much as you eat ha here are your tracks now well see where you come in except for the sharp tips of the toes the tracks were not unlike the print of a tiny hand and there was no mistaking them for the tracks of any other animal tommy studied them until he was sure that all were made by one raccoon and he was convinced that he had but one to deal with at length he found the place where the animal was in the habit of entering the field there was just the suggestion of a path through the grass in the direction of the green forest it was very clear that bobby coon came and went regularly that way and of course this was the place to set a trap tommys face clouded again at the thought i believe ill go up to the old wishingstone and think it out he muttered so he headed for the familiar old wishingstone that overlooked the green meadows and the cornfield and was not so very far from the green forest and when he reached it he sat down it is doubtful if tommy ever got past that old stone without sitting down on it this time he had no intention of wishing himself into anything yet hardly had he sat down when he did you see his thoughts were all of bobby coon and so without stopping to think where he was he said to no one in particular there are some things i want to know about raccoons i wish i could be one long enough to find out tommys wish had come true he was no longer tommy the boy but tommy the coon he was a thickset rather clumsylooking graycoated fellow with a black ringed tail and a black band across the eyes his ears were sharp and his face was not unlike that of reddy fox in its outline his toes were long and bare and when he walked it was with his whole foot on the ground as a man does and as a bear does in fact although he didnt know it he was own cousin to buster bear tommys home was a hollow tree with the entrance high up inside he had a comfortable bed and there he spent his days sleeping away the long hours of sunshine night was the time he liked best to be abroad and then he roamed far and wide without fear reddy fox he was not afraid of at all in fact there was no one he feared much but man and in the darkness of the night he thought he need not even fear him tommys hollow tree was in a swamp through which flowed a brook and it was tommys delight to explore this brook sometimes up sometimes down in it were fish to be caught and tommy as a boy never delighted in fishing more than did tommy as a coon on moonlight nights he would steal softly up to a quiet pool and on the very edge of it possess himself in patience as a good fisherman should presently a careless fish would swim within reach a swift scoop with a black little paw with five sharp little hooks extendedand the fish would be high and dry on the shore it was great fun sometimes he would visit marshy places where the frogs were making the night noisy with a mighty chorus this was the easiest kind of hunting he had only to locate the spot from which one of those voices issued steal softly up and there was one less singer though the voice would hardly be missed in the great chorus occasionally he would take a hint from jerry muskrat and where the water was very shallow dig out a few mussels or freshwater clams at other times just by way of varying his bill of fare he would go hunting this was less certain of results but exciting and when successful the reward was great especially was this so in the nesting season and many a good meal of eggs did tommy have to say nothing of tender young birds occasionally he prowled through the treetops in hope of surprising a family of young squirrels in their sleep none knew better than he that in the light of day he could not catch them but at night when they could not see and he could it was another matter but fish meat and eggs were only a part of tommys diet fruit berries and nuts in their season were quite as much to his liking not to mention certain tender roots one day quite by chance while he was exploring a hollow tree he discovered that it already had tenants and that they were makers of the most delicious sweets he ever had tasted in short he almost made himself sick on wild honey his long hair protecting him from the little lances of the bees after that he kept a sharp eye out for sweets and so discovered that bumblebees make their nests in the ground and that while they contained a scant supply of honey there was enough as a rule to make it worth while to dig them open so tommy grew fat and lazy there was plenty to eat without working very hard for it and he shuffled about in the green forest and along the laughing brook eating whatever tempted him and having a good time generally he dearly loved to play along the edge of the water and was as tickled as a child with anything bright and shiny once he found a bit of tin shining in the moonlight and spent most of the remainder of that night playing with it about one thing he was very particular if he had meat of any kind and there was water near he always washed it carefully before eating in fact tommy was very neat it was born in him sometimes daylight caught him far from his hollow tree then he would look for an old nest of a hawk or crow and curl up in it to sleep the day away if none was handy and he could find no hollow tree or stump he would climb a big tree and stretch himself flat along one of the big limbs and there sleep until the black shadows came creeping through the green forest once in a while he would be discovered by the sharp eyes of sammy jay or blacky the crow and then life would be made miserable for him until he would be glad to wake up and seek some hidingplace where they could not see him it was for this reason chiefly that he always tried to get back to his own snug den by the time jolly round red mr sun shook his rosy blankets off and began his daily climb up in the blue blue sky illustration once in a while he would be discovered one night he met bobby coon himself where do you live asked tommy over on the mountain replied bobby in a hollow tree asked tommy no oh my no replied bobby ive got the nicest den in a ledge of rock no more hollow trees for me why not demanded tommy they arent safe retorted bobby i used to live in a hollow tree but ive learned better i guess youve never been hunted when youve been nearly choked to death by smoke in your hollow tree or had it cut down with you in it and barely escaped by the skin of your teeth you wont think so much of hollow trees give me a good rocky den every time but where does the smoke come from and why should my hollow tree be cut down asked tommy to whom this was all new and very strange hunters replied bobby briefly you wait until the cool weather comes and youll find out what i mean but who are the hunters and what do they hunt us for persisted tommy my but you are innocent retorted bobby they are those twolegged creatures called men and i dont know what they hunt us for they just do thats all they seem to think its fun i wish one of them would have to fight for his life perhaps he wouldnt see so much fun in it then it was last fall that they drove me out of my hollow tree and they pretty nearly got me too but they wont do it this year you take my advice and get a den in the rocks then you can laugh at them but what will they hunt me for i havent done them any harm persisted tommy that doesnt have anything to do with it retorted bobby they do it for fun have you tried the corn yet its perfectly delicious come on and well have a feast now of course tommy was ready for a feast the very thought of it put everything else out of his head he shuffled along behind bobby coon through the green forest across a little stretch of meadow and under the bars of a fence into a cornfield for a minute he sat and watched bobby it was tommys first visit to a cornfield and he didnt know just what to do but bobby did oh yes bobby did he stood up on his hind legs and pulled one of the more slender stalks down until he could get at the lowest ear then he stripped off the husk and took a huge bite of the tender milky kernels ummm said bobby coon and took another tommy waited no longer he found a stalk for himself and two minutes later he was stuffing himself with the most delicious meal he ever had tasted at least he thought so then he forgot all about dens and hunters he had no thought for anything but the feast before him here was plenty and to spare he dropped the ear he was eating and climbed a big stalk to strip another ear the first one was good but this one was better perhaps a third would be better still so he sampled a third the moon flooded the cornfield with silvery light it was just the kind of a night that all raccoons love and in that field of plenty bobby and tommy were perfectly happy they did not know that they were in mischief how should they the corn was no more than other green things growing of which they were free to help themselves so they wandered about taking here a bite and there a bite and wasting many times as much as they ate suddenly in the midst of their good time there sounded the yelp of a dog and there was something about it that sent a chill of fright along tommys backbone it was an excited and joyous yelp and yet there was something threatening in it it was followed by another yelp and then another each more excited than the others and then it broke into a fullthroated roar in which there was something fierce and terrifying it was coming nearer through the corn tommy looked over to where he had last seen bobby coon he wasnt there but a rustling of the cornstalks beyond told him that bobby was running running for his life tommy was in a panic he never had had to run for his life before where should he go to the green forest of course where there were trees to climb in a tree he would be safe then he heard another sound the shout of a man he remembered what bobby coon had said about trees and a new fear took possession of him while he still hesitated the dog passed only a few yards away in the corn tommy heard the rustle of the stalks and the roar of his savage voice and then suddenly he knew that the dog was not after him he was following the tracks of bobby coon swiftly tommy stole through the corn and ran across the bit of meadow his heart in his mouth to the great black bulk of the green forest he ran swiftly surprisingly so for such a clumsylooking fellow how friendly the tall trees looked they seemed to promise safety it was hard to believe that bobby coon was right and that they did not he kept on nor stopped until he was in his own hollow tree the voice of the dog came to him growing fainter and fainter in the direction of the mountain and finally ceased altogether he wondered if bobby reached his den and was safe of one thing tommy was certain that cornfield was no place for him so he kept away from it and tried not to think of how good that milky corn had tasted so the summer passed and the fall came with falling leaves and sharp frosty nights they gave tommy even more of an appetite though there had been nothing the matter with that before he grew fatter and fatter so that it made him puff to run unknown to him old mother nature was preparing him for the long winter sleep by this time the memory of the dog and of what bobby coon had said about hollow trees had almost dropped from his mind he was concerned over nothing but filling his stomach and enjoying those frosty moonlight nights he interfered with no one and no one interfered with him one night he had gone down to the laughing brook fishing without warning there broke out on the still air the horrid sound of that yelping dog tommy listened for just a minute this time it was his trail that dog was following there could be no doubt about it tommy turned and ran swiftly but he was fat and heavy and he could hear the dog gaining rapidly straight for his hollow tree fled tommy and even as he reached it the dog was almost at his heels up the tree scrambled tommy and from the safe vantage of a big limb which was the threshold of his home he looked down the dog was leaping up against the base of the tree excitedly and his voice had changed he was barking a feeling of relief swept over tommy the dog could not climb he was safe but presently there were new sounds in the green forest the shouting of men lights twinkled and drew nearer staring down from the edge of his hole tommy saw eager cruel faces looking up with a terrible fear gripping his heart he crept down into his bed presently the tree shook with the jar of an ax blow followed blow the tree vibrated to each blow and the vibrations passed through tommys body so that it shook but it shook still more with a nameless and terrible fear at last there was a sharp cracking sound tommy felt himself falling through space he remembered what bobby coon had told him and he wondered if he would be lucky enough to escape as bobby did then he shut his eyes tight waiting for the crash when the tree should strike the ground when he opened his eyes he wasjust tommy sitting on the wishingstone overlooking the green meadows his face was wet with perspiration was it from the sun beating down upon him or was it from the fear that had gripped him when that tree began to fall a shudder ran over him at the memory he looked over to the cornfield where he had found the tracks of bobby coon and the mischief he had wrought what was he to do about it somehow strangely his sympathy was with bobby he doesnt know any better muttered tommy he thinks that corn belongs to him as much as to anybody else and there isnt any reason why he shouldnt think so it isnt fair to trap him or kill him for something he doesnt know he shouldnt do if he just knew enough to eat what he wants and not waste so much i guess there wouldnt be any trouble hes just like a lot of folks who have so much they dont know what to do with it only they know better than to waste it and he doesnt i know what ill do ill take bowser down there tonight and give him a scare ill give him such a scare that he wont dare come back until the corn is so hard he wont want it thats what ill do my it must be awful to think youre safe and then find youre trapped i guess i wont ever hunt coons any more i used to think it was fun but i never thought how the coon must feel now i know andandwell a live coon is a lot more interesting than a dead one anyway funny what i find out on this old wishingstone if i keep on i wont want to hunt anything any more tommy got up stretched began to whistle as if there was a load off his mind and started for home still whistling and his whistle was good to hear chapter four how tommy envied honker the goose the feel of spring was in the air the sound of it filled tommys ears the smell of it filled his nostrils and caused him to take long deep breaths the sight of it gladdened his eyes and the joy of it thrilled his heart for the spring you know has really arrived only when it can be felt heard smelled and seen and has the power to fill all living things with abounding joy and happiness winter had been long in going it seemed to tommy that it never would go he liked winter oh yes tommy liked winter he liked to skate and slide to build snow forts and houses and make snow men he liked to put on his snowshoes and tramp through the green forest for many are the secrets of the summer which the winter reveals to those with eyes to see and tommy was trying to train his eyes to be of that kind but when it was time for winter to go he wanted it to go quickly and it hadnt it had dragged on and dragged on to be sure there had been a few springlike days but they had been only an aggravation but this day was different and tommy knew that at last spring had arrived it was not that it was long past time for it was now almost april it was something more it was just a something that throbbing all through him told him that this time there was no mistakespring was really here there was a softness in the touch of gentle sister southwind which was like a caress from over in the green forest came the gurgle of the laughing brook and mingling with it was the soft whistle of winsome bluebird the cheery song of welcome robin the joyous greeting of little friend the songsparrow the clear lilt of carol the meadowlark the sweet love call of tommy tit the chickadee and under all a subdued murmur sensed rather than really heard as of a gentle stirring of reawakened life so tommy heard the spring and in each long breath he drew there was the odor of damp warm soil such as the earth gives up only at this season and so tommy smelled the spring and looking from the top of the hill above the wishingstone down across the green meadows to the old pasture and beyond to the purple hills he saw all as through a soft and beautiful haze which was neither fog nor smoke but as if old mother nature had drawn an exquisite veil over the face of the earth until it should be made beautiful and so tommy saw the spring he whistled joyously as he tramped down to the dear old wishingstone and sat down on it his hands clasped about his crossed knees seasons came and went but the wishingstone the great gray stone which overlooked the green meadows remained always the same how many many winters it must have seen go and how many many springs it must have seen come some early and some like this one late but all beautiful in all the years it had been there how many of old mother natures children little people in fur little people in feathers little people in scaly suits and little people with neither fur nor feathers nor scales but with gauzy or beautifully colored wings or crawling with many feet must have rested there just as he was doing now somehow tommy always got to thinking of these little people whenever he sat on the wishingstone from it he had watched many of them and learned much of their ways but he had learned still more by wishing that seems queer but it was so he had wished that he was a meadowmouse and no sooner had he wished it than he had been one in turn he had wished himself into a red squirrel a rabbit and a mink and he had lived their lives had learned how they work and play how sometimes they have plenty but quite as often go hungry sometimes very hungry and how always they are under the shadow of fear and the price of life is eternal watchfulness i suppose some people would say that i fell asleep and dreamed it all but i know better said tommy if they were dreams why dont i have the same kind at home in bed but its only out here on this old stone when i wish i were something that i become it so of course it isnt a dream now i think of it every single time ive wished myself one of these little animals it has been because i thought they had a better and an easier time than i do and every time ive been mighty glad that im just what i am i wonder he paused a minute for a sudden thought had popped into his head i wonder he finished if those wishes came true just to teach me not to be discontented i wonder if a wish would come true if i werent discontented he was still wondering when floating down out of the sky came a clear honk honk honk khonk honk honk khonk instantly tommy turned his freckled face and eager eyes skyward wild geese he exclaimed honk honk khonk honk the sound was loud and clear but it seemed to come from nowhere in particular and everywhere in general of course it came from somewhere up in the sky but it was very hard to place it as from any particular part it was a good two minutes before tommys eyes sharp as they were found what he was looking fora black wedge moving across the sky a wedge made up of little black living spots at least they looked little that was because they were so high so very high in the sky he knew that each of those black spots was a great broadwinged birda canada goose he could see the long outstretched necks as tiny black lines one behind another in two long lines which met in a letter v like welldrilled soldiers maintaining perfect formation the leader at the apex of the v and behind him each bird a given distance from the one in front they moved steadily across the sky straight into the north honk honk khonk honk khonk khonk honk there was something indescribably thrilling in the sound it made the blood leap and race through tommys veins long after the living wedge had passed beyond his vision those clarion notes rang in his earshonk honk khonk honk khonk khonk honk they were at once a challenge and a call to the wild freedom of the great wilderness they filled his heart with a great longing it swelled and pulsed with a vast desire oh he sighed it must be great to be able to fly like that i would rather fly than do anything i know of i envy old honker in the lead there i do i wish i could join him this very minute of course that wish had slipped out unthinkingly but that made no difference tommy had wished and now here he was high in the air no longer a boy but a great bird the last one in a long line of great birds beating the thin air with stout tireless wings as they followed honker the leader straight into the north far far below lay the great world it seemed to tommy that he had no part in it now a fierce tumultuous joy surged through him and demanded expression spring had come and he must tell those plodding creatures mere specks crawling on the distant earth honk honk khonk honk khonk never in all his life had tommy felt such a thrill as possessed him now looking down he saw brown meadows and pastures showing just a hint of green here and there green forests and bare woodlands silver threads which he knew to be rivers shining spots which were lakes and ponds and villages which looked like toys once they passed over a great city but it did not look great at all seen through the murk of the smoke from many factory chimneys it was not unlike an anthill which had been openedtiny black objects which were really men women children horses and motorcars seeming to hurry aimlessly in all directions for all the world like ants so all day they flew crying the glad message of the spring to the crawling things below just a little while before the setting of the sun honker the leader slanted down toward a shining spot in the heart of a great forest and the others followed rapidly the shining spot grew in size until below them lay a pond far from the homes of men and to the very middle of this honker led the way while the whole flock broke into excited gabbling for they had flown far and were tired with a splash honker struck the water and with splash after splash the others followed tommy the last because you know he was at the end of one of those long lines then for a while they rested the wise old leader scanning the shores with keen eyes for possible danger satisfied that all was well he gave a signal and led the way to a secluded cove where the water was shallow and the shore marshy it was clear that he had been there before and had come with a purpose slowly they swam honker well in the lead necks held high the eyes of all alert and studying the nearing shore there was no honking now not a sound to tommy in his inexperience such watchfulness seemed needless what possible danger could there be in such a lonely place but he wisely kept his place and did as the others did at length they were close to shore and honker gave a low signal which meant that all was well instantly the formation was broken and with a low contented gabbling the flock began feeding on eelgrass roots and sedges from the mud at the bottom for an hour they fed then they swam about or sat on the shore preening their feathers while the shadows deepened but all the time honker and some of the older ganders with eyes and ears alert were on guard and when at last tommy put his head under his wing to sleep a great content filled his heart illustration honker on the watch the next day was much like the first with break of day they had breakfasted and then at a signal from honker they had mounted up up into the blue vault and all day they had heralded the spring to the earth below as they flew into the north so it was the next day and the next wise old honker leading them to some chosen secluded restingplace each night gradually the face of the earth below changed there were no more cities the villages became smaller and farther between and at last they saw no more only here and there a lonely farm great forests and lakes succeeded each other the air grew colder but with his thick coat of feathers tommy minded it not at all then one day they found they had outflown the spring below them the earth was still frozen and snowcovered the ponds and lakes were still icebound reluctantly honker turned back to their last stoppingplace and there for a week they rested in peace and security though not in contentment for the call of the north the far north with its nestinggrounds was ever with them and made them impatient and eager to be on their way the daily flights were shorter now and there were frequent rests of days at a time for spring advanced slowly and they must wait for the unlocking of the lakes and rivers the forests changed the trees became low and stunted at last they came to a vast region of bogs and swamps and marshes around shallow lakes and ponds a great lonely wilderness a mighty solitude at least that is what tommy would have thought it had he been a boy or a man instead of a smart young gander it was neither lonely nor a solitude to him now but the haven which had been the object of those hundreds of miles of strongwinged flight it was the nestingground it was home and how could it be lonely with flock after flock of his own kind coming in every hour of every day with thousands of ducks pouring in in swift winged flight and countless smaller birds all intent on homebuilding the flock broke up into pairs each intent on speedily securing a home of their own on the ground they made great nests of small sticks and dead grass with a soft lining of down in each presently were four or five big eggs and soon there were downy goslingsscores and scores of themin the water with their mothers for the first swimming lesson then the old birds had to be more vigilant than before for there were dangers many of them even in that far wilderness prowling foxes hungry lynxes crafty mink hawks fierce owls each watching for the chance to dine on tender young goose so the summer short in that far northern region passed and the young birds grew until they were as large as their parents and able to care for themselves cold winds swept down out of the frozen arctic ocean with warning that already winter had begun the southward march then began a great gathering of the geese and a dividing into flocks each with a chosen leader chosen for his strength his wisdom and his ability to hold his leadership against all comers many a battle between ambitious young ganders and old leaders did tommy see but he wisely forbore to challenge old honker the leader who had led the way north and when the latter gathered the flock for the journey he was one of the first to fall in line a thousand plus a thousand miles and more stretched before them as they turned to the south but to the strength of their broad wings the distance was as nothing but this was to be a very different journey from their trip north as tommy soon found out then they had been urged on day by day by a great longing to reach their destination now in place of longing was regret there was no joy in the going they were going because they must they had no choice winter had begun its southward march the flights were comparatively short for where food was good they stayed until some subtle sense warned old honker that it was time to be moving it was when they had left the wilderness and reached the great farmlands that they lingered longest there in the stubble of the grain fields was feed aplenty and every morning at dawn and again every afternoon an hour or so before sundown honker led the way to the fields during the great part of the day and all night they rested and slept on the bar of a river or well out on the bosom of a lake it was now that tommy learned a new respect for the cunning of the wise old leader and also that terrible fear which comes sooner or later to all wild creaturesthe fear of man time and again as they approached their chosen feedingground there would come a sharp signal from honker and he would abruptly turn the direction of the flight and lead them to another and much poorer feedingground yet look as he would tommy could see no cause no danger at first tommy thought it was because other geese seemed to have reached the feedingground first he could see them standing stiffly as if watching the newcomers near them a harmless little heap of straw he knew that the feeding was better there and he wanted to go but the spirit of obedience was strong within him and he followed with the rest once he voiced his disapproval to another bird as they settled some distance away where it was more work to find the scattered grain watch he replied in a low tone there comes a flock led by that young upstart who fought and defeated his old leader the day before we left home he is leading them straight over there tommy watched suddenly from that harmlesslooking little heap of straw there sprang two spurts of flame followed by two sharp reports that struck terror to his heart even as he beat his way into the air he looked and saw that foolish young leader and two of his flock falling stricken and helpless to the earth and a man leap from under the straw to pick them up then he understood and a new loyalty to old honker grew in his heart but in spite of the everpresent danger honker kept his flock there for food was good and plentiful and he had faith in himself and his flock had faith in him so they lingered until a driving snow squall warned them that they must be moving keeping just ahead of the oncoming winter they journeyed south and at every stoppingplace they found men and guns waiting there was no little pond so lonely but that death might be lurking there sometimes the call of their own kind would come up to them looking down they would see geese swimming in seeming security and calling to them to come down and join them more than once honker set his wings to accept the invitation only to once more beat his way upward as his keen eyes detected something amiss on the shore and so tommy learned the baseness of man who would use their own kind to decoy them to death came at last a sudden swift advance of cold weather which forced them to fly all night when day broke they were weary of wing and worse the air was thick with driving snow for the first time tommy beheld honker uncertain he still led the flock but he led he knew not where for in the driving snow none could see low they flew now but a little way above the earth making little progress against the driving storm and so weary of wing that it was all they could do to keep their heavy bodies up it was then that the welcome honk of other geese came up to them and heading in the direction of the calling voices and honking back their distress they discovered water below and gladly oh so gladly set their wings and dropped down into this haven of refuge hardly had the first ones hit the water when bang bang bang bang the fateful guns roared and when out of the confusion into which they were thrown they once more gathered behind their old leader far out in the middle of the pond some of the flock were missing in clear weather they flew high and it happened on such a day that as tommy looked down there stirred within him a strange feeling below stretched a green forest with broad meadows beyond and farther still an old brushgrown pasture somehow it was wonderfully familiar eagerly he looked there should be something more ah there it wasan old gray boulder overlooking the meadows like a magnet it seemed to draw tommy down to itself honk honk honk khonk tommy heard the call of his old leader faintly as if from a distance honk honk honk khonk honk khonk honk tommy opened his eyes and rubbed them confusedly where was he honk honk honk khonk honk khonk he looked up there high in the blue sky was a living wedge pointing straight into the north and the joy of the spring was in the wild clamor that came down to him slowly he rose from the old wishingstone and with his hands thrust in his pockets watched the flock until it was swallowed up in the distant haze long he stood gazing through unseeing eyes while the wild notes still came to him faintly and the joy of them rang in his heart but there was no longing there now only a vast content it must be great to fly like that he murmured it must be great but he drew a long breath as he looked over the meadows to the old pasture and heard and saw and felt the joy of the springthis is good enough for me he finished i dont envy that old leader a bit it may be glorious to be wild and free to look down and see the great world and all that but its more glorious to be safe and carefree andand just a boy no i dont envy old honker a little bit but isnt he wonderful ii dont see what men want to hunt him for and try to kill him they wouldnt if they knew how wonderful he is i never will no sir i never will i know how it feels to be hunted andand its dreadful thats what it isdreadful i know and its all because of the old wishingstone im glad i know andandgee im glad its spring honk honk honk khonk honk khonk another flock of geese were passing over and tommy knew that they too were glad oh so glad that it was spring two of tommys acquaintances reddy fox and jerry muskrat he thought he knew all about but he found that there was much he didnt know and there were two who live deep in the great woods whom he had never seen paddy the beaver and buster bear so to the friendly old wishingstone tommy went and what he learned there you may learn from the next volume tommys change of heart tommys change of heart tommys change of heart chapter one how it happened that reddy fox gained a friend it was funny that tommy never could pass that gray stone without sitting down on it for a few minutes it seemed as if he just couldnt that was all it had been a favorite seat ever since he was big enough to drive the cows to pasture and go after them at night it was just far enough from home for him to think that he needed a rest when he reached it you know a growing boy needs to rest often except when he is playing he used to take all his troubles there to think them over the queer part of it is he left a great many of them there though he didnt seem to know it if tommy ever could have seen in one pile all the troubles he had left at that old gray stone i am afraid that he would have called it the troublestone instead of the wishingstone it was only lately that he had begun to call it the wishingstone several times when he had been sitting on it he had wished foolish wishes and they had come true at least it seemed as if they had come true they had come as true as he ever wanted them to he was thinking something of this kind now as he stood idly kicking at the old stone presently he stopped kicking at it and from force of habit sat down on it it was a bright sunshiny day one of those warm days that sometimes happen right in the middle of winter as if the weatherman had somehow got mixed and slipped a spring day into the wrong place in the calendar from where he sat tommy could look over to the green forest which was green now only where the pinetrees and the hemlocktrees and the sprucetrees grew all the rest was bare and brown save that the ground was white with snow he could look across the white meadowland to the old pasture where in places the brush was so thick that in summer he sometimes had to hunt to find the cows now even from this distance he could trace the windings of the cowpaths each a ribbon of spotless white it puzzled him at first he scowled at them when the whole thing is covered with snow it ought to be harder to see those paths but instead of that it is easier he muttered it isnt reasonable he scowled harder than ever but the scowl wasnt an unpleasant one you know there is a difference in scowls some are black and heavy like ugly thunderheads and from them flashes of anger are likely to dart any minute just as the lightning darts out from the thunderheads others are like the big fleecy clouds that hide the sun for a minute or two and make it seem all the brighter by their passing there are scowls of anger and scowls of perplexity it was a scowl of the latter kind that wrinkled tommys forehead now he was trying to understand something that seemed to him quite beyond common sense it isnt reasonable he repeated i ought not to be able to see em at all but i do they stick out like no one will ever know just what they stuck out like for tommy never finished that sentence the scowl cleared and his freckled face fairly beamed he had made a discovery all by himself and he felt all the joy of a discoverer perhaps you will think it wasnt much but it was really important so far as it concerned tommy because it proved that tommy was learning to use his eyes and to understand what he saw he had reasoned the thing out and when anybody does that it is always important why how simple exclaimed tommy of course i can see those old paths it would be funny if i couldnt the bushes break through the snow on all sides but where the paths are there is nothing to break through and so they are perfectly smooth and stand right out queer i never noticed that before hello whats that his sharp eyes had caught sight of a little spot of red up in the old pasture it was moving and as he watched it it gradually took shape it was reddy fox trotting along one of those little white paths apparently reddy was going to keep an engagement somewhere for he trotted along quite as if he were bound for some particular place and had no time to waste hes headed this way and if i keep still perhaps hell come close thought tommy so he sat as still as if he were part of the old wishingstone itself reddy fox came straight on at the edge of the old pasture he stopped for a minute and looked across to the green forest as if to make sure that it was perfectly safe to cross the green meadows evidently he thought it was for he resumed his steady trot if he kept on the way he was headed he would pass very near to the wishingstone and to tommy just as he was halfway across the meadows chanticleer tommys prize plymouth rock rooster crowed over in the farmyard instantly reddy stopped with one black paw uplifted and turned his head in the direction of the sound tommy could imagine the hungry look in that sharp crafty face but reddy was far too wise to think of going up to the farmyard in broad daylight and in a moment resumed his journey nearer and nearer he came until he was passing not thirty feet away how handsome he was his beautiful red coat looked as if the coldest wind never could get through it his great plume of a tail black toward the end and just tipped with white was held high to keep it out of the snow his black stockings white vest and blacktipped ears gave him a wonderfully fine appearance quite a dandy is reddy fox and he looked it he was almost past when tommy squeaked like a mouse like a flash reddy turned his sharp ears cocked forward his yellow eyes agleam with hunger there he stood as motionless as tommy himself eagerness written in every line of his face it was very clear that no matter how important his business in the green forest was he didnt intend knowingly to pass anything so delicious as a meadowmouse again tommy squeaked instantly reddy took several steps toward him looking and listening intently a look of doubt crept into his eager face that old gray stone didnt look just as he remembered it for a long minute he stared straight at tommy then a puff of wind fluttered the bottom of tommys coat and perhaps at the same time it carried to reddy that dreaded man smell reddy almost turned a backsomersault in his hurry to get away then he ran how he did run in almost no time at all he had reached the green forest and vanished from tommys sight quite without knowing it tommy sighed my how handsome he is you know tommy is frecklefaced and rather homely and gee how he can run he added admiringly it must be fun to be able to run like that it might be fun to be a fox anyhow i wonder what it feels like i wish i were a fox illustration then he ran how he did run if he had remembered where he was perhaps tommy would have thought twice before wishing but he had forgotten forgetting was one of tommys besetting sins hardly had the words left his mouth when tommy found that he was a fox redcoated blackstockingedthe very image of reddy himself and with that change in himself everything else had changed it was summer the green meadows and the green forest were very beautiful even the old pasture was beautiful but tommy had no eyes for beauty all that beauty meant nothing to him save that now there was plenty to eat and no great trouble to get it everywhere the birds were singing but if tommy heeded at all it was only to wish that some of the sweet songsters would come down on the ground where he could catch them those songs made him hungry he knew of nothing he liked better next to fat meadowmice than birds that reminded him that some of them nest on the ground mrs grouse for instance he had little hope that he could catch her for it seemed as if she had eyes in the back of her head but she should have a family by this time and if he could find those youngstersthe very thought made his mouth water and he started for the green forest once there he visited one place after another where he thought he might find mrs grouse he was almost ready to give up and go back to the green meadows to hunt for meadowmice when a sudden rustling in the dead leaves made him stop short and strain his ears there was a faint kwitt and then all was still tommy took three or four steps and thencould he believe his eyesthere was mrs grouse fluttering on the ground just in front of him one wing dragged as if broken tommy made a quick spring and then another somehow mrs grouse just managed to get out of his way but she couldnt fly she couldnt run as she usually did it was only luck that she had managed to evade him very stealthily he approached her as she lay fluttering among the leaves then gathering himself for a long jump he sprang once more he missed her by a mere matter of inches it seemed the same thing happened again and still again it was maddening to have such a good dinner so near and yet not be able to get it then something happened that made tommy feel so foolish that he wanted to sneak away with a roar of wings mrs grouse sailed up over the treetops and out of sight huh havent you learned that trick yet said a voice tommy turned there was reddy fox grinning at him what trick he demanded why that old grouse was just fooling you replied reddy there was nothing the matter with her she was just pretending she had a whole family of young ones hidden close by the place where you first saw her my but you are easy lets go right back there cried tommy no use not the least bit declared reddy its too late lets go over on the meadows and hunt for mice together they trotted over to the green meadows all through the grass were private little paths made by the mice the grass hung over them so that they were more like tunnels than paths reddy crouched down by one which smelled very strong of mouse tommy crouched down by another presently there was the faint sound of tiny feet running the grass moved ever so little over the small path reddy was watching suddenly he sprang and his two black paws came down together on something that gave a pitiful squeak reddy had caught a mouse without even seeing it he had known just where to jump by the movement of the grass presently tommy caught one the same way then because they knew that the mice right around there were frightened they moved on to another part of the meadows i know where there are some young woodchucks said tommy who had unsuccessfully tried for one of them that very morning where demanded reddy over by that old tree on the edge of the meadow replied tommy it isnt the least bit of use to try for them they dont go far enough away from their hole and their mother keeps watch all the time there she is now sure enough there sat old mrs chuck looking at that distance for all the world like a stake driven in the ground come on said reddy well have one of those chucks but instead of going toward the woodchuck home reddy turned in quite the opposite direction tommy didnt know what to make of it but he said nothing and trotted along behind when they were where reddy knew that mrs chuck could no longer see them he stopped theres no hurry said he there seems to be plenty of grasshoppers here and we may as well catch a few when mrs chuck has forgotten all about us well go over there tommy grinned to himself if he thinks we are going to get over there without being seen hes got something to learn thought tommy but he said nothing and for lack of anything better to do he caught grasshoppers after a while reddy said he guessed it was about time to go chuckhunting you go straight over there said he when you get near mrs chuck will send all the youngsters down into their hole and then she will follow only shell stay where she can peep out and watch you go right up to the hole so that she will go down out of sight and then wait there until i come ill hide right back of that tree and then you go off as if you had given up trying to catch any of them go hunt meadowmice far enough away so that she wont be afraid ill do the rest tommy didnt quite see through the plan but he did as he was told as he drew near mrs chuck she did just as reddy said she wouldsent her youngsters down underground then as he drew nearer she followed them tommy kept on right up to her doorstep the smell of those chucks was maddening he was tempted to try to dig them out only somehow he just felt that it would be of no use he was still half minded to try however when reddy came trotting up and flattened himself in the long grass behind the trunk of the tree tommy knew then that it was time for him to do the rest of his part he turned his back on the woodchuck home and trotted off across the meadow he hadnt gone far when looking back he saw mrs chuck sitting up very straight and still on her doorstep watching him not once did she take her eyes from him tommy kept on and presently began to hunt for meadowmice but he kept one eye on mrs chuck and presently he saw her look this way and that as if to make sure that all was well then she must have told her children that they could come out to play once more for out they came by this time tommy was so excited that he almost forgot that he was supposed to be hunting mice presently he saw a red flash from behind the old tree there was a frightened scurry of little chucks and old mrs chuck dove into her hole reddy barked joyfully tommy hurried to join him reddy had been quite as successful as he had boasted he would be and was grinning didnt i tell you wed have chuck for dinner said reddy what one cant do two can after that tommy and reddy often hunted together and reddy taught tommy many things so the summer passed with plenty to eat and nothing to worry about not once had he known that terrible fearthe fear of being huntedwhich is so large a part of the lives of danny meadow mouse and peter rabbit and even chatterer the red squirrel instead of being afraid he was feared he was the hunter instead of the hunted day and night for he was abroad at night quite as much as by day he went where he pleased and did as he pleased and was happy for there was nothing to worry him having plenty to eat he kept away from the homes of men he had been warned that there was danger there at last the weather grew cold there were no more grasshoppers there were no more foolish young rabbits or woodchucks or grouse for those who had escaped had grown up and were wise and smart every day it grew harder to get enough to eat the cold weather made him hungrier than ever and now he had little time for sunnaps or idle play he had to spend most of the time that he was awake hunting he never knew where the next meal was coming from as did thrifty striped chipmunk and happy jack squirrel and danny meadow mouse it was hunt hunt hunt and a meal only when his wits were sharper than the wits of those he hunted he knew now what real hunger was he knew what it was most of the time so when late one afternoon he surprised a fat hen who had strayed away from the flock behind the barn of a lonely farm he thought that never had he tasted anything more delicious thereafter he visited chickenhouses and stole many fat pullets to him they were no more than the wild birds he hunted only more foolish and so easily caught and then one morning after a successful raid on a poultryhouse he heard for the first time the voices of dogs on his trail he the hunter was being hunted at first it didnt bother him at all he would run away and leave them far behind so he ran and when their voices were faint and far away he lay down to rest but presently he grew uneasy those voices were drawing nearer those dogs were following his every twist and turn with their noses in his tracks just as he had so often followed a rabbit for hours he ran and still those dogs followed he was almost ready to drop when he chanced to run along in a tiny brook and after he left that he heard no more of the dogs that day so he learned that running water broke his trail the next day the dogs found his trail again and as he ran from them through a swamp there was a sudden flash and a dreadful noise something stung him sharply on the shoulder as he looked back he caught a glimpse of a man with something in his hands that looked like a stick with smoke coming from the end of it that night as he lay licking his wounds he knew that now he who had known no fear would never again be free from itthe fear of man little by little he learned how to fool and outwit the dogs he learned that water destroyed his scent he learned that dry sand did not hold it he learned to run along stone walls and then jump far out into the field and so break his trail he learned that if he dashed through a flock of sheep the foolish animals would rush around in aimless fright and their feet would stamp out his trail these and many other sharp tricks he learned so that after a while he had no fear of the dogs but his fear of man grew greater rather than less and was with him at all times so all through the fall he hunted and was hunted then came the snow the beautiful white snow all day it fell and when at night the moon came out the earth was covered with a wonderful white carpet through the green forest and over the meadows tommy hunted one lone shivering little woodmouse he dug out of a moldering old stump but this was only a bite he visited one henhouse after another only to find each without so much as a loose board by means of which he might get in it was dreadful to be so hungry as if this were not enough the breaking of the day brought the sound of dogs on his trail ill fool them in short order thought he alas running in the snow was a very different matter from running on the bare ground one trick after another he tried the very best he knew the ones which never had failed before but all in vain wherever he stepped he left a footprint plain to see though he might fool the noses of the dogs he could not fool the eyes of their masters now one thing he had long ago learned and this was never to seek his underground den unless he must for then the dogs and the hunters would know where he lived so now tommy ran and ran hoping to fool the dogs but not able to at last he realized this and started for his den he felt that he had to running in the snow was hard work his legs ached with weariness his great plume of a tail of which he was so proud was a burden now it had become wet with the snow and so heavy that it hampered and tired him a great fear a terrible fear filled tommys heart would he be able to reach that snug den in time he was panting hard for breath and his legs moved slower and slower the voices of the dogs seemed to be in his very ears glancing back over his shoulder he could see them gaining with every jump the fierce joy of the hunt and the lust of killing in their eyes he knew now the feeling the terror and dreadful hopelessness of the meadowmice and rabbits he had so often run down just ahead was a great gray rock from it he would make one last long jump in an effort to break the trail in his fear he quite forgot that he was in plain sight now and that his effort would be useless up on the rock he leaped wearily andtommy rubbed his eyes then he pinched himself to make quite sure that he was really himself he shivered for he was in a cold sweatthe sweat of fear before him stretched the snowcovered meadows and away over beyond was the old pasture with the cowpaths showing like white ribbons halfway across the meadows running toward him with their noses to the ground and making the echoes ring with the joy of the hunt were two hounds a dark figure moving on the edge of the old pasture caught his eyes and held them it was a hunter reddy fox handsome crafty reddy into whose hungry yellow eyes he had looked so short a time before would soon be running for his life hastily tommy jumped to his feet and hurried over to the trail reddy had made as he ran for the green forest with eager feet he kicked the snow over those telltale tracks for a little way he waited for those eager hounds and when they reached the place where he had broken the trail he drove them away they and the hunter might pick up the trail again in the green forest but at least reddy would have time to get a long start of them and a good chance of getting away altogether then he went back to the wishingstone and looked down at it thoughtfully and i actually wished i could be a fox he exclaimed my but im glad im not i guess reddy has trouble enough without me making him any more he may kill a lot of innocent little creatures but he has to live and its no more than men do he was thinking of the chicken dinner he would have that day im going straight over to the old pasture and take up that trap i set yesterday i guess a boys troubles dont amount to much after all im more glad than ever that im a boy andandwell if reddy fox is smart enough to get one of my chickens now and then hes welcome it must be awful to be hungry all the time chapter two tommy becomes a furry engineer paddy the beaver lives in the great woods far from the dwellingplace of man often and often had tommy wished that paddy lived in the green forest near his home that he might make his acquaintance for he had read many wonderful things about paddy and they were hard to believe if i could see em for myself just see em with my own eyes i could believe but so many things are written that are not true that a feller doesnt know what to believe and what not to a feller ought to see things to know that they are so said tommy as he strolled down towards the big gray stone that overlooked the green meadows course its easy enough to believe that beavers build houses muskrats do that i know all about muskrats and i spose a beavers house is about the same thing as a muskrats only bigger and better but how any animal can cut down a big tree or build a dam or dig a regular canal is more than i can understand without seeing for myself i wish tommy didnt finish his wish i suspect he was going to wish that he could go into the great woods and hunt for paddy the beaver but he didnt finish his wish because just then a new thought popped into his head you know how it is with thoughts they just pop out from nowhere in the queerest way it was so now with tommy he suddenly thought of the wishingstone the great gray stone just ahead of him and he wondered if he should sit down on it if he could wish himself into a beaver always before when he had wished himself into an animal or a bird it was one of those with which he was familiar and had seen this case was different there were no beavers anywhere near where tommy lived and so he was a little doubtful if he could wish himself into a beaver why he could wish himself into anythinga lion or an elephant or anything elseand learn about all the animals no matter where they lived gee exclaimed tommy and there was a queer little catch in his breath because you know it was such a big idea he stood still and slowly rubbed the bare toes of one foot up and down the other bare brown leg gee he exclaimed again and stared very hard at the wishingstone twont do any harm to try it anyway he added so he walked over to the wishingstone and sat down with his chin in his hands and his elbows on his knees he stared over at the green forest and tried to imagine that it was the great woods where the only human beings ever seen were hunters or trappers or lumbermen and where bears and deer and moose and wolves lived and where beavers built their homes and made their ponds and lived their lives far from the homes of men as he stared the green forest seemed to change to the great woods i wish said he slowly and dreamily i wish that i were a beaver he was no longer sitting on the wishingstone he was a young beaver with a waterproof fur coat a broad flat tail and great chisellike teeth in the front of his jaws his tools his home was in the heart of the great woods where a broad shallow brook sparkled and dimpled and the sun breaking through the treetops kissed its ripples in places it flowed swiftly dancing and singing over stones and pebbles again it lingered in deep dark cool holes where the trout lay farther on it loafed lazily through wild meadows where the deer delighted to come but where tommy was it rested in little ponds quiet peaceful in a dreamy stillness where the very spirit of peace and happiness and contentment seemed to brood on one side of one of these little ponds was the house a great house of sticks bound together with mud and turf the house in which tommy lived with others of his family it was quite the finest beaverhouse in all that region but tommy didnt think anything about that it was summer now the season of play of having a good time without thought of work it was the season of visiting and of exploration in company with some of his relatives he made long journeys up and down the brook and even across to other brooks on some of which were other beaver colonies and on some of which were no signs that beavers ever had worked there but when summer began to wane tommy found that life was not all a lazy holiday and that he was expected to work the home settlement was rather crowded there was danger that the food supply would not be sufficient for so many hungry beavers so it was decided to establish a new settlement on one of the brooks which they had visited in their summer journey and tommy was one of a little company which under the leadership of a wise old beaver started forth on a still night to found the new colony he led the way straight to one of the brooks on the banks of which grew many aspen trees for you must know that the favorite food of beavers is the bark of aspens and poplars it was very clear that this wise old leader had taken note during the summer of those trees and of the brook itself for the very night of their arrival he chose a certain place in the brook and announced that there they would build their dam isnt it a great deal of work to build a dam asked tommy who knew nothing about dambuilding the dam at his old home having been built long before his time illustration isnt it a great deal of work to build a dam it is yes indeed it certainly is replied an old beaver youll find it so before we get this dam built then whats the use of building it asked tommy i dont see the use of a dam here anyway there are places where the banks are steep enough and the water deep enough for splendid holes in which to live then all weve got to do is to go cut a tree when we are hungry im sure i for one would much rather swim around and have a good time the other looked at him out of eyes that twinkled and yet in a way to make tommy feel uncomfortable you are young said he and the prattle of young tongues is heedless what would you do for food in winter when the brook is frozen the young think only of today and the good times of today and forget to prepare for the future when you have learned to work you will find that there is in life no pleasure so great as the pleasure of work well done now suppose you let us see what those teeth of yours are good for and help cut these alders and haul them over to the place where the dam is to be tommy had no reply ready and so he set to work cutting young alders and willows as the rest were doing these were floated or dragged down to the place chosen for the dam where the water was very shallow and were laid side by side with the big ends pointing up stream turf and stones and mud were piled on the brushy ends to keep them in place so the foundations of the dam were laid from bank to bank then more poles were laid on top and more turf and mud short sticks were wedged in between and helped to hold the long sticks in place tommy grew tired of working but no one else stopped and he was ashamed to one of his companions cut a big poplar and others helped him trim off the branches this was for food and when the branches and trunk had been stripped of bark they were floated down to the new dam and worked into it the trunk being cut into lengths which could be managed easily thus nothing went to waste so all through the stilly night they worked and when the day broke they sought the deep water and certain holes under the banks wherein to rest but before he left the dam the wise old leader examined the work all over to make sure that it was right when the first shadows crept forth late the next afternoon the old leader was the first back on the work one by one the others joined him and another night of labor had begun some cut trees and saplings some hauled them to the dam and some dug up turf and mud and piled it on the dam there was no talking everybody was too busy to talk illustration some cut trees and saplings some hauled them to the dam most of tommys companions had helped build dams before and knew just what to do tommy asked no questions but did as the others did slowly the dam grew higher and tommy noticed that the brook was spreading out into a pool for the water came down faster than it could work its way through that pile of poles and brush twigs and leaves and grass floated down from the places higher up where the beavers were at work and when these reached the dam they were carried in amongst the sticks by the water and lodged there helping to fill up the holes and hold the water back as night after night the dam grew higher and the pool behind it grew broader and deeper tommy began to take pride in his work he no longer thought of play but was as eager as the others to complete the dam the stars looked down from the soft sky and twinkled as they saw the busy workers at last the dam was completed for the time being at least very thoroughly the wise old leader went all over it inspecting it from end to end and when he was satisfied he led his band to one side of the little pond formed by the dam and there he chose a site for the house wherein they would spend the winter first a platform of sticks and mud and turf was built until it was a few inches above the water then began the raising of the walls a mass of brush and turf until the walls were three feet thick and so solid that jack frost would find it quite useless to try to get inside the roof was in the shape of a rough dome and at the top was comparatively thin here little or no mud was used so that there were tiny airholes for like all other warmblooded animals a beaver must breathe within was a comfortable room of which the platform was the floor from this two burrows or tunnels led down on the deepwater side one of these being on a gradual incline that food sticks might the easier be dragged in the entrances to both were at the very bottom of the pond where there would be no danger of them being closed by ice when the pond should freeze in winter these were the only entrances so that no foe could reach them unless he were able to swim under water and there were no such swimmers whom they had cause to fear when the house was finished tommy thought that their labors would be at an end and he was almost sorry for he had learned to love work but no sooner was the house completed than all the beavers went lumbering yes sir that is just what they did they went lumbering just as men do only they cut the trees for food instead of for boards they began at the edge of a little grove of aspens to which the pond now nearly extended sitting on his haunches with his broad tail for a seat or a prop as his fancy pleased each little woodsman grasped the tree with his hands and bit into the trunk a bite above and a bite below and then with his teeth pried out the chip between the two bites exactly as a man with an ax would cut it was slow hard work cutting out a chip at a time in this way but sooner or later the tree would begin to sway a bite or two more and it would begin to topple over then the little workman would thud the ground sharply with his tail to warn his neighbors to get out of the way and he himself would scamper to a place of safety while the tree came crashing down tommy dearly loved to see and hear those trees come crashing to the ground no sooner was a tree down than they trimmed off the branches and cut the trunk into short lengths these logs they rolled into the water where with the larger branches they were floated out to deep water close by the house and there sunk to the bottom what for tommy didnt have to be told this was the beginning of their foodpile for the winter so the days slipped away and the great foodpile grew in the pond with such busy workers it did not take long to cut all the trees close by the pond the farther away from the water they got the greater the labor of dragging and rolling the logs and also the greater danger from lurking enemies in the water they felt wholly safe but on land they had to be always on the watch for wolves and bears and lynxes when they had reached the limit of safety the wise old leader called a halt to tree cutting and set them all to digging and what do you think it was they were digging why a canal it was easier and safer to lead the water from the pond to the place where the trees grew than to get the logs over land to the pond so they dug a ditch or canal about two and a half feet wide and a foot and a half deep piling the mud up on the banks until at last it reached the place where they could cut the trees and roll the logs into the canal and so float them out to the pond then the cutting began again tommy was happy never had he been more happy there was something wonderfully satisfying in just looking at the results of their labor and in feeling that he had had a part in it all yet his life was not all labor without excitement indeed it was far from it had tommy the beaver been able to remember what as tommy the boy he had read he would have felt that he was just like those hardy pioneers who built their homes in the wilderness always in that great still wilderness death with padded feet and cruel teeth and hungry eyes sought to steal upon the beavers so always as they worked especially when on the land they were prepared to rush for safety at the first warning never for a minute did they cease to keep guard testing every breath of air with wonderfully sensitive noses and listening with hardly less wonderful ears on nose and ears the safety of a beaver almost wholly depends his eyes being rather weak once tommy stopped in his labor of cutting a big tree so that he might rest for a minute or two on the very edge of the little clearing they had made the moonlight fell on an old weathergray log tommy stared at it a moment then resumed his work a few minutes later he chanced to look at it again somehow it seemed nearer than before he stared long and hard but it lay as motionless as a log should once more he resumed his work but hardly had he done so when there was the warning thud of a neighbors tail instantly tommy scrambled for the water and even as he did so he caught a glimpse of that gray old log coming to life and leaping toward him the instant he reached the water he dived what was it he whispered tremulously when in the safety of the house he touched noses with one of his neighbors tufty the lynx was the reply i smelled him and gave the warning i guess it was lucky for you that i did i guess it was returned tommy with a shiver another time a huge black form sprang from the blacker shadows and caught one of the workers it was a bear sometimes there would be three or four alarms in a night so tommy learned that the harvesting of the food supply was the most dangerous labor of all for it took him farthest from the safety of the water at last this work was completed and tommy wondered if now they were to rest and idle away their time but he did not have to wonder long the old leader was not yet content but must have the pond deepened all along the foot of the dam and around the entrances to the house so now they once more turned to digging this time under water bringing the mud up to put on the dam or the house some working on one and some on the other the nights grew crisp and there was a hint of frost it was then that they turned all their attention to the house plastering it all over with mud save at the very top where the airholes were so thick did they lay it on that only here and there did the end of a stick project then came a night which made a thin sheet of ice over the pond and froze the mudplaster of the house the cold increased the ice grew thicker and the walls of the house so hard that not even the powerful claws of a bear could tear them open it was for this that that last coating of mud had been put on the nights of labor were over at last there was nothing to do now but sleep on the soft beds of grass or of thin splinters of wood for some had preferred to make beds of this latter material for exercise they swam in the quiet waters under the ice when they were hungry they slipped down through the water tunnel and out into the pond swam to the foodpile got a stick and took it back to the house where they gnawed the bark off in comfort and at their ease afterward carrying the bare stick down to the dam for use in making repairs once they discovered that the water was rapidly lowering this meant a break in the dam a trapper had cut a hole in it and cunningly placed a trap there but the wise old leader knew all about traps and the breach was repaired without harm to any one sometimes a lynx or a wolf would come across the ice and prowl around the house sniffing hungrily as the smell of beaver came out through the tiny airholes in the roof but the thick walls were like rock and tommy and his companions never even knew of these hungry prowlers peace safety and contentment reigned under the ice of the beaverpond but at last there came a day when a great noise reverberated under the ice they knew not what it meant and lay shivering with fear a long time they lay even after it had ceased then one of the boldest went for a stick from the foodpile he did not return another went and he did not return finally tommy went for he was hungry when he reached the foodpile he found that it had been fenced in with stout poles driven down into the mud through holes cut in the ice it was the cutting of these holes that had made the dreadful noise though tommy didnt know it around the foodpile he swam until at last he found an opening between the poles of the fence he hesitated then because he was very hungry he entered hardly was he inside when another pole was thrust down through a hole behind him and he was a prisoner under the ice inside that hateful fence now a beaver must have air and there was no air there and no way of getting any up above on the ice an indian squatted he knew just what was happening down below and he grinned beside him lay the two beavers who had preceded tommy drowned now tommy was drowning his lungs felt as if they would burst dully he realized that this was the end as long as he could he held his breath and thentommy came to himself with a frightened jump he was sitting on the old wishingstone and before him stretched the green meadows joyous with happy life he wasnt a beaver at all but he knew that he had been a beaver that he had lived the life of paddy the beaver he could remember every detail of it and he shuddered as he thought of those last dreadful minutes at the foodpile when he had felt himself drowning helplessly then the wonder of what he had learned grew upon him why he exclaimed a beaver is an engineer a lumberman a dredger a builder and a mason hes wonderful hes the most wonderful animal in all the world his face clouded why cant people leave him alone he exploded a man that will trap and kill one of those little chaps is worse than a lynx or a wolf yes sir thats what he is those creatures kill to eat but man kills just for the few dollars paddys fur coat will bring when i grow up im going to do something to stop trapping and killing yes sir thats what im going to do tommy got up and stretched then he started for home and there was a thoughtful look on his freckled face gee he exclaimed ive learned a pile this time i didnt know there was so much pleasure in just work before i guess i wont complain any more over what i have to do iim mighty glad i was a beaver for a little while just for that and then whistling tommy headed straight for the woodpile and his ax he had work to do and he was glad of it chapter three why tommy took up all his traps if there was one thing that tommy enjoyed above another it was trapping there were several reasons why he enjoyed it in the first place it took him out of doors with something definite to do he loved the meadows and the woods and the pastures and all the beauties of them with which old mother nature is so lavish he loved to tramp along the laughing brook and around the smiling pool always no matter what the time of the year there was something interesting to see now it was a flower new to him or a bird that he had not seen before again it was a fleeting glimpse of one of the shy fleetfooted little people who wear coats of fur he liked these best of all because they were the hardest to surprise and study in their home life and that was one reason why he enjoyed trapping so much it was matching his wits against their wits and one other reason was the money which he got for the pelts so tommy was glad when the late fall came and it was time to set traps and every morning make his rounds to see what he had caught in the coldest part of the winter when the snow was deep and the ice was thick he stopped trapping but he began again with the beginning of spring when the laughing brook was once more set free and the smiling pool no longer locked in icy fetters it was then that the muskrats and the minks became most active and their fur coats were still at their best you see the more active they were the more likely they were to step into one of his traps on this particular afternoon after school tommy had come down to the smiling pool to set a few extra traps for muskrats the trapping season that is the season when the fur was still at its best or prime as the fur dealers call it would soon be at an end he had set a trap on an old log which lay partly in and partly out of the water he knew that the muskrats used this old log to sun themselves because one had plunged off it as he came up so he set a trap just under water on the end of the old log where the first muskrat who tried to climb out there would step in it ill get one here as sure as shooting said tommy then he found a little grassy tussock and he knew by the matteddown grass that it was a favorite resting place for muskrats here he set another trap and left some slices of carrot as bait by the merest accident he found a hole in the bank and from the look of it he felt sure that it had been made by one of the furry little animals he wanted to catch right at the very entrance he set another trap and artfully covered it with watersoaked leaves from the bottom of the smiling pool so that it could not be seen id like to see anything go in or out of that hole without getting caught said he with an air of being mightily tickled with himself and his own smartness so he went on until he had set all his traps and all the time he was very happy spring had come and it is everybodys right to be happy in the spring he heard the joyous notes of the first birds who had come on the lagging heels of winter from the warm southland and they made him want to sing himself everything about him proclaimed new life and the joy of living he could feel it in the very air it was good to be alive after the last trap had been put in place he sat down on an old log to rest for a few minutes and enjoy the scene the smiling pool was as smooth as polished glass presently as tommy sat there without moving two little silver lines which met and formed a v started on the farther side of the smiling pool and came straight toward him tommy knew what those silver lines were they were the wake made by a swimming muskrat my i wish id brought my gun thought tommy its queer how a fellow always sees things when he hasnt a gun and never sees them when he has he could perceive the little brown head very plainly now and as it drew nearer he could distinguish the outline of the body just under the surface and back of that the queer rubbery flattened tail set edgewise in the water and moving rapidly from side to side its a regular propeller thought tommy and he certainly knows how to use it it sculls him right along if he should lose that he sure would be up against it tommy moved ever so little so as to get a better view instantly there was a sharp slap of the tail on the water a plunge and only a ripple to show that a second before there had been a swimmer there two other slaps and plunges sounded from distant parts of the smiling pool and tommy knew that he would see no more muskrats unless he sat very still for a long time slowly he got to his feet stretched and then started for home all the way across the green meadows he kept thinking of that little glimpse of muskrat life he had had and for the first time in his life he began to think that there might be something more interesting about a muskrat than his fur coat always before he had thought of a muskrat as simply a rat a big overgrown cousin of the pests that stole the grain in the henhouse and against whom every mans hand is turned as it should be but somehow that little glimpse of jerry muskrat at home had awakened a new interest it struck him quite suddenly that it was a very wonderful thing that an animal breathing air just as he did himself could be so at home in the water and disappear so suddenly and completely it must be fine to be able to swim like that thought tommy as he sat down on the wishingstone and looked back across the green meadows to the smiling pool i wonder what he does down there under water now i think of it i dont know much about him except that he is the only rat with a fur that is good for anything if it wasnt for that fur coat of his i dont suppose anybody would bother him what a snap he would have then i guess he has no end of fun in the summer with nothing to worry about and plenty to eat and always cool and comfortable no matter what the weather what gets me is how he spends the winter when everything is frozen he must be under the ice for weeks i wonder if he sleeps the way the woodchuck does i suppose i can find out just by wishing seeing that im sitting right here on the old wishingstone it would be a funny thing to do to wish myself into a rat it doesnt seem as if there could be anything very interesting about the life of anything so stupidlooking as a muskrat and yet ive thought the same thing about some other creatures and found i was wrong he gazed dreamily down toward the smiling pool and the longer he looked the more he wondered what it would be like to live there at last almost without knowing it he said the magic words ii wish i were a muskrat he murmured tommy was in the smiling pool he was little and furcoated with a funny little flattened tail and he really had two coats the outer of long hairs a sort of waterproof while the under coat was soft and fine and meant to keep him warm and though he was swimming with only his head out of water he wasnt wet at all it was a beautiful summer evening just at the hour of twilight and the smiling pool was very beautiful the most beautiful place that ever was at least it seemed so to tommy in the bulrushes a few little feathered folks were still twittering sleepily over on his big green lilypad grandfather frog was leading the frog chorus in a great deep voice from various places in the smiling pool came sharp little squeaks and faint splashes it was playtime for little muskrats and visiting time for big muskrats illustration it was playtime for the little muskrats an odor of musk filled the air and was very pleasant to tommy as he sniffed and sniffed he was playing hideandseek and tag with other little muskrats of his own age and not one of them had a care in all the world far away hooty the owl was sending forth his fierce hunting call but no one in the smiling pool took the least notice of it by and by it ceased tommy was chasing one of his playmates in and out among the bulrushes twice they had been warned by a wise old muskrat not to go beyond the line of bulrushes into the open water but little folks are forgetful especially when playing tommys little playmate forgot in the excitement of getting away from tommy he swam out where the first little star was reflected in the smiling pool a shadow passed over tommy and hardly had it passed when there was a sharp slap of something striking the water tommy knew what it was he knew that it was the tail of some watchful old muskrat who had discovered danger and that it meant dive at once tommy dived he didnt wait to learn what the danger was but promptly filled his little lungs with air plunged under water and swam as far as he could when he just had to come up for more air he put only his nose out and this in the darkest place he knew of among the rushes there he remained perfectly still down inside his heart was thumping with fear of he knew not what there wasnt a sound to be heard around the smiling pool it was as still as if there was no living thing there after what seemed like a long long time the deep voice of grandfather frog boomed out and then the squeak of the old muskrat who had given the alarm told all within hearing that all was safe again at once all fear left tommy and he swam to find his playmates what was it he asked one of them hooty the owl was the reply didnt you see him i saw a shadow replied tommy that was hooty i wonder if he caught anybody returned the other tommy didnt say anything but he thought of the playmate who forgot and swam out beyond the bulrushes and when he had hunted and hunted and couldnt find him he knew that hooty had not visited the smiling pool for nothing so tommy learned the great lesson of never being careless and forgetting later that same night as he sat on a little muddy platform on the edge of the water eating a delicious tender young lilyroot there came that same warning slap of a tail on the water tommy didnt wait for even one more nibble but plunged into the deepest water and hid as before this time when the signal that all was well was given he learned that some one with sharper ears than his had heard the footsteps of a fox on the shore and had given the warning just in the nick of time four things tommy learned that night first that safe and beautiful as it seems the smiling pool is not free from dangers for little muskrats second that forgetfulness means a short life third that to dive at the instant a dangersignal is sounded and inquire later what the danger was is the only sure way of being safe and fourth that it is the duty of every muskrat who detects danger to warn every other muskrat though he didnt realize it then this last was the most important lesson of all it was the great lesson that human beings have been so long learning and which many have not learned yet that just in proportion as each one looks out for the welfare of his neighbors he is himself better off instead of having just one pair of little eyes and one pair of keen little ears to guard him against danger tommy had many pairs of little eyes and little ears keeping guard all the time some of them better than his own eating sleeping and playing and of course watching out for danger were all that tommy had to think about through the long lazy summer and he grew and grew and grew until he was as big as the biggest muskrats in the smiling pool and could come and go as he pleased there was less to fear now from hooty the owl for hooty prefers tender young muskrats he had learned all about the ways of reddy fox and feared him not at all he had learned where the best lilyroots grow and how to find and open mussels those clams which live in fresh water he had a favorite old log half in the water to which he brought these to open them and eat them and more than one fight did he have before his neighbors learned to respect this as his he had explored all the shore of the smiling pool and knew every hole in the banks he had even been some distance up the laughing brook life was very joyous but as summer began to wane the days to grow shorter and the nights longer he discovered that playtime was over at least all his friends and neighbors seemed to think so for they were very very busy something inside told him that it was time high time that he also went to work cold weather was coming and he must be prepared for one thing he must have a comfortable home and the only way to get one was to make one for himself of course this meant work but somehow tommy felt that he would feel happier if he did work he was tired of doing nothing in particular in his roamings about he had seen many muskrat homes some of them old and deserted and some of them visited while the owners were away he knew just what a firstclass house should be like it should be high enough in the bank to be above water at all times even during the spring floods and it should be reached by a passage the entrance to which should at all times be under water even in the driest season on the bank of the smiling pool grew a tree and the spreading roots came down so that some of them were in the smiling pool itself under them tommy made the entrance to his burrow the roots hid it at first the digging was easy for the earth was little more than mud but as the passage slanted up the digging became harder still he kept at it two or three times he stopped and decided that he had gone far enough then changed his mind and kept on at last he found a place to suit him and there he made a snug chamber not very far under the grassroots when he had finished it he was very proud of it he told jerry muskrat about it have you more than one entrance to it asked jerry no replied tommy it was hard enough work to make that one jerry turned up his nose that wouldnt do for me he declared a house with only one entrance is nothing but a trap supposing a fierce old mink should find that doorway while you were inside what would you do then tommy hadnt thought of that once more he went to work and made another long tunnel leading up to that snug chamber and then perhaps because he had got the habit he made a third from one of these tunnels he even made a short branch with a carefully hidden opening right out on the meadow for tommy liked to prowl around on land once in a while the chamber he lined with grass and old rushes until he had a very comfortable bed with all this hard work completed you would have supposed that tommy would have been satisfied wouldnt you but he wasnt he found that some of his neighbors were building houses of a wholly different kind and right away he decided that he must have one too so he chose a place where the water was shallow and not too far from the place where the waterlilies grew and there among the bulrushes he once more set to work this time he dug out the mud and the roots of the rushes piling them around him until he was in a sort of little well from this he dug several tunnels leading to the deep water where he could be sure that the entrance never would be frozen over the mud and sods he piled up until they came above the water and then he made a platform of rushes and mud with an opening in the middle down into that well from which his tunnels led on this platform he built a great mound of rushes and grass and even twigs all wattled together some of them he had to bring clear from the other side of the smiling pool and as he built that mound he made a nice large room in the middle biting off all the ends of sticks and rushes which happened to be in the way when he had made that room to suit him he made a comfortable bed there just as he had in the house in the bank then he built the walls very thick adding rushes and mud and sods all around except on the very top there he left the roof thinner with little spaces for the air to get in for of course he must have fresh air to breathe when at last the new house was finished he was very proud of it there were two rooms the upper one with its comfortable bed quite above the water and the lower one wholly under water connected with the former by a little doorway the only way of getting into the house was by one of his tunnels to the lower room when all was done an old muskrat looked it over and told him that he had done very well for a young fellow which made tommy feel very important the weather was growing cool now so tommy laid up some supplies in both houses and then spent his spare time calling on his neighbors by this time he had grown a fine thick coat and didnt mind at all how cold it grew in fact he liked the cold weather it was about this time that he had a dreadful experience he climbed out one evening on his favorite log to open and eat a mussel he had found there was a snap and something caught him by the tail and pinched dreadfully he pulled with all his might but the dreadful thing wouldnt let go he turned and bit at it but it was harder than his teeth and gnaw as he would he could make no impression on it a great terror filled his heart and he struggled and pulled heedless of the pain until he was too tired to struggle longer he just had to lie still after a while when he had regained his strength he struggled again this time he felt his tail give a little a neighbor swam over to see what all the fuss was about its a trap said he its lucky you are not caught by a foot instead of by the tail if you keep on pulling you may get free i did once this gave tommy new hope and he struggled harder than ever at last he fell headlong into the water the cruel steel jaws had not been able to keep his tapered tail from slipping between them he was free but oh so frightened after that tommy grew wise he never went ashore without first examining the place for one of those dreadful traps and he found more than one it got so that he gave up all his favorite places and made new ones once he found one of his friends caught by a forefoot and he was actually cutting his foot off with his sharp teeth it was dreadful but it was the only way of saving his life those were sad and terrible times around the smiling pool and along the laughing brook for the people in fur but there didnt seem to be anything they could do about it except to everlastingly watch out one morning tommy awoke to find the smiling pool covered with ice he liked it a sense of great peace fell on the smiling pool there was no more danger from traps except around certain spring holes and there was no need of going there much of the time tommy slept in that fine house of rushes and mud its walls had frozen solid and it was as comfortable as could be imagined a couple of friends who had no house stayed with him when they were hungry all they had to do was to drop down into the tunnel leading to deep water and so out into the smiling pool under the ice dig up a lilyroot and swim back and eat it in comfort inside the house if they got short of air while swimming under the ice they were almost sure to find little air spaces under the edge of the banks no matter how bitter the cold or how wild the storm above the icebelow it was always calm and the temperature never changed sometimes tommy went over to his house in the bank once while he was there a bloodthirsty mink followed him tommy heard him coming and escaped down one of the other passages then he was thankful indeed that he had made more than one but this was his only adventure all the long winter at last spring came the ice disappeared and the water rose in the laughing brook until it was above the banks and in the smiling pool until tommys house was nearly under water then he moved over to his house in the bank and was comfortable again one day he swam over to his house of rushes and climbed up on the top he had no thought of danger there and he was heedless snap a trap set right on top of the house held him fast by one leg a mist swam before his eyes as he looked across the green meadows and heard the joyous carol of welcome robin why oh why should there be such misery in the midst of so much joy he was trying to make up his mind to lose his foot when far up on the edge of the meadows he saw an old gray rock somehow the sight of it brought a vague sense of comfort to him he strained his eyes to see it better andtommy was just himself rubbing his eyes as he sat on the old wishingstone i was just going to cut my foot off ugh he shuddered two or three times ive found a foot in my traps but i never realized before what it really meant why those little chaps had more nerve than ill ever have he gazed thoughtfully down toward the smiling pool then suddenly he sprang to his feet and began to run toward it its too late to take all of em up tonight he muttered but ill take what i can and tomorrow morning ill take up the rest i hope nothing will get caught in em i never knew before how dreadful it must be to be caught in a trap ill never set another trap as long as i live so there why jerry muskrat is almost as wonderful as paddy the beaver and he doesnt do anything a bit of harm i didnt know he was so interesting he hasnt as many troubles as some but he has enough i guess without me adding to them say thats a great life he leads if it wasnt for traps it wouldnt be half bad to be a muskrat of course its better to be a boy but i can tell you right now im going to be a better boyless thoughtless and cruel jerry muskrat you havent anything more to fear from me not a thing i take off my hat to you for a busy little worker and for having more nerve than any boy i know and never again did tommy set a trap for little wild folk chapter four tommy learns what it is like to be a bear tommys thoughts were straying somehow they were straying most of the time these days they had been ever since that day when he had wished himself into a beaver he dreamed of the great woods where rivers have their beginnings in gurgling brooks and great lakes reflect mossgray giants of the forest where the beavers still ply their many trades unharmed by man the deer follow paths of their own making the otters make merry on their slipperyslides the lynx pass through the dark shadows themselves but grayer shadows and bears go fishing gather berries and hunt the stored sweets of the bees in short the spell of the great woods the wilderness unmarred by the hand of man was upon tommy eagerly he read all that he could find about the feathered and furred folk who dwell there and the longing to know more about them and their ways to learn these things for himself grew and grew he wanted to hear things with his own ears and see things with his own eyes sometimes he went over to the green forest near his home and played that it was the great woods and that he was a mighty hunter then happy jack the gray squirrel became a fierceeyed tuftedeared bobtailed lynx saucy chatterer the red squirrel became a crafty fisher the footprints of reddy fox grew in size to those of a wolf peter rabbit was transformed into his cousin of the north jumper the hare and a certain old black stump was buster bear but it was only once in a while that tommy played the hunter somehow since he had learned so many things about the lives of the little feathered and furred people about him he cared less and less about hunting them so most often when the green forest became the great woods he was buster bear that was more fun than being a hunter much more fun there was only one drawbackhe didnt know as much about buster bear and his ways as he wished he did so now as he trudged along towards the pasture to drive home the cows for the evening milking his thoughts were straying to the great woods and buster bear as he came to the old wishingstone he glanced up at the sun there was no need to hurry he would have plenty of time to sit down there a while so down he sat on the big gray rock and his thoughts went straying straying deep into the great woods far from cows and milking and the woodpile just beyond the kitchen door bears never had to chop wood i wish said tommy dreamily that i were a bear that was all just a little spoken wish but tommy was no longer a dreamy boy with evening chores yet to be done he was a little black furry animal not unlike an overgrown puppy following at the heels of a great gaunt black bear in short tommy was a bear himself all about him was the beautiful wilderness the great woods of his boyish dreams just behind him was another little bear his twin sister and the big bear was their mother presently they came to an opening where there were no trees but a tangle of brush years before fire had swept through there though tommy knew nothing about that in fact tommy knew little about anything as yet save that it was good oh so good to be alive on the edge of this opening mother bear paused and sat up on her haunches while she sniffed the air the two little bears did the same thing they didnt know why but they did it because mother bear did then she dropped to all fours and told them to remain right where they were until she called them they watched her disappear in the brush and waited impatiently it seemed to them a very long time before they heard her call and saw her head above the bushes as she sat up but really it was only a few minutes then they scampered to join her each trying to be first when they reached her such a glad sight as greeted them all about were little bushes loaded with berries that seemed to have stolen their color from the sky they were blueberries with funny little squeals and grunts they stripped the berries from the bushes and ate and ate until they could eat no more then they wrestled with each other and stood up on their hind legs and boxed until they were out of breath and glad to lie down for a rest while mother bear continued to stuff herself with berries it was very beautiful there in the great woods and the two little bears just bubbled over with high spirits they played hideandseek behind stumps and trees they played tag they chased each other up tall trees one would climb to the top of a tall stump and the other would follow and try to knock the first one off sometimes both would tumble down and land with a thump that would knock the breath from their little bodies the bumps would hurt sometimes and make them squeal this would bring mother bear in a hurry to see what had happened and when she would find that no harm had come to them she would growl a warning and sometimes spank them for giving her a fright but best of all they loved to wrestle and box and though they didnt know it they were learning something they were learning to be quick in their movements they were learning how to strike swiftly and how to dodge quite as swiftly once in a while they would stand and not try to dodge but see who could stand the hardest blow and once in a while i am sorry to say they quarreled and fought then mother bear would take a hand and cuff and spank them until they squalled very early they learned that mother bear was to be minded once she sent them up a tree and told them to stay there until she returned then she went off to investigate something which interested her when she returned the two little cubs were nowhere to be seen they had grown tired of waiting for her to return and had come down to do a little investigating of their own it didnt take her long to find them oh my no and when she didwell all the neighbors knew that two little cubs had disobeyed and two little cubs were sure very sure that they never would do so again tommy was one at first during those lovely summer days mother bear never went far from them you see when they were very small there were dangers oh yes there are dangers even for little bears tufty the lynx would have liked nothing better than a meal of tender young bear and howler the wolf would have rejoiced in an opportunity to snatch one of them without the risk of an encounter with mother bear but tommy and his sister grew fast very fast you see there were so many good things to eat their mother dug for them the most delicious roots tearing them from the ground with her great claws it wasnt long before they had learned to find them for themselves and to dig them where the earth was soft enough then there were berries raspberries and blackberries and blueberries all they wanted to be had for the gathering and by way of variety there were occasional fish tommy as a boy was very fond of fishing as a bear he was quite as fond of it on his first fishingtrip he got a wetting a spanking and no fish it happened this way mother bear had led them one moonlight night to a brook they never had visited before up the brook she led them until they reached a place where it was broad and shallow the water gurgling and rippling over the stones and singing merrily they were left in the brush on the edge of the brook where they could see and were warned to keep still and watch then mother bear stationed herself at a point where the water was just a wee bit deeper than elsewhere and ran a wee bit faster for it had cut a little channel there for a long time she sat motionless a big black spot in the moonlight which might have been a stump to eyes which had not seen her go there tommy wondered what it all meant for a long time at least it was a long time to tommy nothing happened the brook gurgled and sang and mother bear sat as still as the very rocks tommy began to get impatient he was bubbling over with high spirits and sitting still was hard very hard little by little he stole nearer to the water until he was on very edge right behind mother bear then he caught a splash down the brook he looked in that direction but could see nothing then there was another splash he saw a silvery line and then made out a moving form there was something alive coming up the brook he edged over a little farther to see better there it was coming nearer and nearer though he didnt know it then it was a big trout working its way up the brook to the springholes higher up where the water was deep and cold in the shallowest places the fish was sometimes half out of water it was making straight for the little channel where mother bear sat nearer it came suddenly mother bear moved like lightning one of her big paws struck down and under scooping the trout out and sending it flying towards the shore alas for tommy he was directly in the way the fish hit him full in the face fell back in the water wriggled and jumped franticallyand was gone tommy was so startled that he gave a frightened little whimper and then a big black paw descended and sent him rolling over and over in the water squalling lustily wet frightened and miserable tommy scrambled to his feet and bolted for the shore where he hid in the brush i didnt mean to he kept whimpering as he watched mother bear return to her fishing presently another trout came along and was sent flying up on the shore then tommy watched his obedient sister enjoy a feast while he got not so much as a taste after that they often went fishing on moonlight nights tommy had learned his lesson and knew that fish were the reward of patience and it was not long before he was permitted to fish for himself sometimes they went frogging along the marshy shores of a little pond this was even more fun than fishing it was great sport to locate a big frog by the sound of his deep bass voice and then softly steal up and cut a chugarum short right in the middle then when he had eaten his fill it was just as much fun to keep on hunting them just to see them plunge with long frightened leaps into the water it tickled tommy immensely and he would hunt them by the hour just for this one day mother bear led them to an old dead tree half rotted away at the bottom while they sat and looked on in roundeyed wonder she tore at the rotten wood with her great claws almost at once the air about her was full of insects humming angrily tommy drew nearer a sharp pain on the end of his nose made him jump and squeal another shooting pain in one ear brought another squeal and he slapped at the side of his head one of those humming insects dropped at his feet it must be that it had had something to do with that pain illustration another shooting pain in one ear brought another squeal tommy beat a retreat into the brush but mother bear kept on clawing at the tree growling and whining and stopping now and then to slap at the insects about her by and by the tree fell with a crash it partly split when it struck the ground then mother bear put her great claws into the crack and tore the tree open for you know she was very strong tommy caught a whiff of something that made his mouth water never in all his short life had he smelled anything so delicious he forgot all about the pain in his nose and his ear and came out of his hidingplace mother bear thrust a great paw into the tree and tore out a piece of something yellow and dripping and tossed it in tommys direction there were a lot of those insects crawling over it but tommy didnt mind the smell of it told him that it must be the best thing that ever was better than berries or fish or frogs or roots and with the first taste he knew that his nose had told the truth it was honey it didnt take tommy a minute to gobble up honey comb bees and all then heedless of stings he joined mother bear what were a few stings compared to such delicious sweets so he learned that hollow trees are sometimes of interest to bears they ate and ate until tommys little stomach was swelled out like a little balloon then they rolled on the ground to crush the bees clinging to their fur after which mother bear led them to a muddy place on the shore of a little pond and the cool mud took out the fire of the stings later tommy learned that not all beetrees could be pulled down in this way but that sometimes they must be climbed and ripped open with the claws of one paw while he held on with the other and endured the stings of the bees as best he could but the honey was always worth all it cost to get next to feasting on honey tommy enjoyed most a meal of ants particularly red ants and this seems queer because red ants are as sour as honey is sweet but it was so any kind of ants were easier to find and to get than honey the latter he had only once in a while but ants he had every day he found them thousands of them under and in rotting old logs and in decayed old stumps he seldom passed an old log without trying to roll it over if he succeeded he was almost sure to find a frightened colony of ants rushing about frantically a few sweeps of his long tongue a smacking of his lips and he moved on sometimes he found grubs of fat beetles and these though not so good as the ants were always acceptable on his bill of fare and he dearly loved to hunt woodmice it was almost as much fun as fishing or frogging so the long summer passed happily and tommy grew so fast that presently he became aware that not even tufty the lynx willingly crossed his path he could go and come unafraid of any of the wilderness dwellers and forgot what fear was until a neverforgotten day in the early fall he had followed mother bear to a certain place where late blueberries still clung to the bushes as she reached the edge of the opening she stopped short and lifted her nose wrinkling the skin of it as she tested the air tommy did the same he had great faith in what his nose could tell him the wind brought to him now a strange smell unlike any he had known an unpleasant smell somehow he didnt know why it gave him a queer prickly feeling all over he looked at mother bear she was staring out into the blueberry patch and her lips were drawn back in an ugly way showing her great teeth tommy looked out in the berrypatch there were two strange twolegged creatures gathering berries they were not nearly as big as mother bear and they didnt look dangerous he stared at them curiously then he turned to look at mother bear she was stealing away so silently that not even a leaf rustled she was afraid tommy followed her taking care not to make the least sound when they were at a safe distance he asked what it meant those were men growled mother bear deep down in her throat and that was the mansmell whenever you smell that steal away men are the only creatures you have to fear but whatever you do keep away from them they are dangerous after that tommy continually tested the air for the dreaded mansmell several times he caught it once from a safe hidingplace he watched a fisherman and another time a party of campers but he took care that they should not suspect that he was near by late fall he was so big that he began to feel independent and to wander off by himself almost every day he would stand up to a tree reach as far up as he could and dig his claws into the bark to see how tall he was with the falling of the beechnuts tommy found a new and delicious food and stuffed himself these days he roamed far and wide and explored all the country for miles around he grew fat and as the weather grew colder his coat grew thicker he learned much about his neighbors and their ways and his sense of humor led him often to give them scares just for the fun of seeing them jump and run with the coming of the first snow a strange desire to sleep stole over him he found a great tree which had been torn up by the roots in some wind storm and about which smaller trees had fallen making a great tangle under the upturned roots of the great tree was a hollow and into this he scraped leaves and the branches of young balsams which he broke off thus he made a comfortable bed and with a sigh of contentment lay down to sleep the snow fell and drifted over his bedroom but he knew nothing of that the cold winds the bitter winds swept through the wilderness and the trees cracked with the cold but tommy slept on days slipped into weeks and weeks into months and still he slept he would not waken until gentle spring melted the snow unless moooo tommys eyes flew wide open for a full minute he stared blinkeringly out over the green meadows then with a jump he came to his feet my gracious its getting late and those cows are wondering what has become of me he exclaimed he hurried toward the pasture breaking into a run for it was milkingtime but his thoughts were far away they were in the great woods ive been a bear he exclaimed triumphantly and i know just how he lives and feels and why he loves the great woods so of all the creatures ive been since i found out about the old wishingstone id rather be buster bear than any one next to being just what i am he has more fun than any one i know of and nothing and nobody to fear but man tommys brow clouded for an instant its a shame he blurted out that every living thing is afraid of man andand i guess its his own fault they neednt ever be afraid of me i can tell them that that old wishingstone has taught me a lot and i am never going to forget how it feels to be hunted and afraid all the time and tommy never

round table what does sir galahad look as if he were about to do why do you think he is starting on a journey rather than returning from one why do you think it must be an important journey how will he go what was expected of a knight in those days tell of some of their good deeds what would you judge the character of this knight to be where is he represented in this picture is he walking or standing still looking at something in particular or lost in thought does he appear angry meek determined hesitating thoughtful or dreamy what do his clasped hands indicate what color is the horse upon what part of the man and horse does the light fall what would you consider the main thought expressed in this picture original picture collection alexander henderson mp london england artist george frederick watts wŏts birthplace london england dates born 1817 died 1904 the story of the picture many wonderful stories have been told of the famous knights of the middle ages but none perhaps more interesting than the adventures of the knight sir galahad when he went in search of the holy grail in those times the greatest praise a boy could hope to receive was you are brave enough to become a knight some day or you are as courteous as a knight and his greatest ambition was to receive this title as he knelt before his sovereign or a superior knight in those days boys were carefully trained for knighthood just as for any other profession they were sent away from home when very young and spent at least ten years under severe discipline and training the boy galahad had passed through these years of preparation he had been taught to be quick in action—managing a horse so that he could jump on or off while it was in full gallop—to throw his spear with sure aim to run swiftly to obey all commands promptly and more difficult still he had learned to wait patiently and uncomplainingly when he could not understand why he should wait now he was twentyone years old knighthood had been bestowed upon him according to the custom by a blow with the flat of the sword on his shoulder as he knelt and the words arise sir galahad and now he was ready to start out on his quest for the holy grail the holy grail was the cup from which christ drank at the last supper it was bought from pilate by joseph of arimathæa and placed in a castle where it was guarded night and day it was passed on to josephs children who received the charge in sacred trust continuing to guard it faithfully the cup itself was most mysterious and wonderful it could be seen only by those who were perfectly pure in word thought and deed if an evil person came near it would seem to be borne away completely disappearing from view the sight of it was as food and new life to the one to whom it was revealed and hence would enable him to live forever make him very wise and of course preserve him from death in battle but there was one thing it did not do—it did not take away temptation to sin no matter how perfect the knight he could still be tempted he must continue to resist evil as long as he lived after a time the holy grail was left in the care of a king named amfortas who weakly yielding to an evil enchantment was severely punished not only was the sight of the grail denied him but a spell was cast upon him and all his court so that they lived in a sort of trance neither sleeping nor waking thus they must remain and suffer until a knight should come pure in body and soul who should break the spell and set them free many a young man began to plan the quest of the grail he must so live that by his good thoughts and deeds he might reach the enchanted castle see the holy grail and so set free the unhappy knights he must be perfect indeed if he would achieve this and full of courage perseverance and patience in our picture we see sir galahad all ready to mount his snowwhite horse and start out on his search for the holy grail he is in full armor his coat of mail which all knights wore was proof against any opponent of the time except one equally armed and armored it is said that a party of knights could ride unharmed through a host of common soldiers the horses too were protected but if the knight were once unhorsed and thrown upon his back he was so weighed down by the stiff and heavy armor that he could not rise again without help the knights weapons consisted of the lance the twohanded sword and a short sharp dagger sir galahad had secured his sword and shield in a most mysterious way the sword had been discovered protruding from the side of a wonderful rock of red marble jutting out from the surface of a river this wonderful sword no one had been able to draw out of the rock but when sir galahad tried the sword came out without the slightest difficulty and when he placed it in his empty scabbard it fitted there exactly the shield had been found by sir galahad in an old church where it had been left for him by an ancestor and where it had remained undiscovered for those many years then too when sir galahad came to the round table of king arthur and his knights in camelot he found them in the midst of a solemn meeting launcelot had just declared that according to prophecy a knight should come that very day who should occupy the siege perilous the siege perilous was a chair over which the magician merlin had cast a spell only a stainless knight could sit in it without danger of instant death as sir galahad entered the room he was preceded by a strange old man whom none had ever seen before then the doors and windows quietly and mysteriously closed of their own accord and the room was filled with a strange light these words in letters of fire appeared over the chair this is galahads seat by all these mysterious happenings the knights knew that sir galahad would be successful in finding the grail and many accompanied him on his quest sir galahad met with many adventures on his quest for the grail and in all of them came out victorious at length he reached the castle of the grail and here he met his first defeat entering the castle he gazed silently about him at the feeble old king and at the wretched company whom he had come to free from their living death before him passed the vision of the grail which he alone of all that company was permitted to see but it was not enough to see all this he was expected to ask the meaning of what he saw and by his question remove the enchantment but overconfident in his own knowledge he tried to solve the mystery without asking and so was forced to depart without success here at the very moment he was about to succeed he was found to be possessed of the one fault overconfidence lacking in that humbleness which seeks constantly for higher knowledge because of his failure to ask the necessary question the enchanted company had to continue to suffer his personal purity alone was not enough wisdom was necessary attainable not through himself alone but from the experience and understanding of others as he left the castle grounds the drawbridge closed with a crash there was a great sound of groaning and of voices reproaching him for having failed in his quest and the castle disappeared from his sight much discouraged he sought it again through many years until at last he found it once more and this time a much wiser man he asked the vital question broke the wicked spell and eventually found the holy grail tennyson has given us the story in verse in his holy grail this picture is one we often see in homes as well as in schoolhouses and in many public buildings it stands for the search for higher ideals which we are all making and so its appeal is universal the earnest uplifted face of the knight is full of youth and beauty the horse with his great intelligent eyes seems to know the importance of his errand the light comes from before them brightening the pathway as if it would lead them on and on through the tangle of vines and deep woods which opposes them if you have been fortunate enough to see a suit of armor in some museum you know how the heavy steel coat is planned and how the helmet which sir galahad has taken off will protect his head and face it is a moment of deep meditation and prayerful thought for sir galahad is about to start out upon an undertaking in which many have failed and in which he cannot be sure of success there is much of humility in his expression nothing of the proud dashing air of the adventurer this earnest thoughtful youth starting out full of courage and determination will always have time for the little courtesies of life for they are a part of his creed a true knight he has been taught should defend to the uttermost the oppressed aid the weak and be brave courteous chaste temperate generous and pious questions to help the pupil understand the picture who was sir galahad upon what quest is he about to start what preparation has he made for it how old is he now how did he receive the title sir what was the holy grail what power had this cup what could it not do for the person who saw it why was the sight of the grail denied to king amfortas what other punishment did he receive who could break this spell how what did sir galahad hope to do how is he dressed what protection was this armor what might happen if he should be unhorsed what weapons did he carry how had sir galahad secured his sword and shield tell about the round table of king arthur and the siege perilous what happened when sir galahad entered of what did all these mysteries persuade the other knights what happened when sir galahad came to the castle of the grail why did he fail what was the result of this defeat when did he succeed what was the result what is the main thought expressed in this picture the story of the artist george frederick watts was born and raised in london england he learned to draw we are told much in the same way he learned to talk his parents encouraged him always and he seems to have had very few obstacles to overcome though watts entered the royal academy school of painting at an early age he did not study there long his art education was thus gained largely by his own efforts and observation he studied ancient greek sculpture closely and his work was always influenced by the classical standard watts lived in an age when the spirit of reform was uppermost and men were preaching thinking and living it no wonder then his work is full of thoughtful purpose urging us on to the best that is in us he said i want to teach people to live to teach something higher than money making or mere pleasure getting to suggest great thoughts he did not paint as many others had for the mere pleasure of it or even from inspiration but rather for some definite purpose in the tate gallery at london is a great collection of the paintings which give the artists message to the world in 1843 the royal commission appointed for the decoration of the new houses of parliament awarded one of the prizes to watts for his fresco design this enabled him to study in italy for three years there he gained much in the richness of his coloring and ease in brushwork of his paintings for the government the first naval victory of the english and st george overcomes the dragon are perhaps the best known other famous pictures by watts are entitled ganymede orpheus and eurydice and psyche in 1867 watts became a member of the royal academy he worked very hard producing a great many paintings with noble generosity he donated a large number of pictures to his country particularly portraits of famous men among them lord tennyson robert browning swinburne dante gabriel rossetti burnejones and william morris the last few years of his life were devoted principally to portrait painting when tennyson was writing elaine he asked watts to tell him his idea of a good portrait and afterwards wrote this description from the answer as when a painter gazing on a face divinely thro all hindrance finds the man behind it and so paints him that his face the shape and color of a mind and life lives for his children ever at his best questions about the artist who was the artist and where was he born what help did he have in realizing his ambition to become an artist what was his aim in painting pictures give in your own words mr wattss idea of what a good portrait should be what helped him to go to italy what benefit did he get from his study in italy name some great men whose portraits watts painted a reading from homer questions to arouse interest what nationality is represented in this picture why do you think so to what are they listening what do their expressions indicate their feelings to be what musical instruments do you see in the picture from the picture would you say that the people are outdoors or indoors why artist sir lawrence almatadema ăl´mätăd´ēmȧ birthplace dronrijp the netherlands dates born 1836 died 1912 the story of the picture let us imagine ourselves in that great walledin city of athens at the time of its greatest prosperity fourth century bc at whatever gate we enter—and there are many of them—our attention will be drawn toward the high steep hill called the acropolis around which the city is built we may reach the top of this hill in a chariot driven over a road of marble or climb the marble steps entering the magnificent gateway where we find many beautiful statues temples and altars from this height we obtain a fine view of the city the sea other small hills temples and flatroofed houses as we look about us we are surprised at the absence of spires or towers there are no high towers or tall buildings most of the houses we see are onestory the reason for this it is said is the frequency of earthquakes the exterior of the houses is very plain they are built of common stone brick or wood coated with plaster and so close to the street that if the door opens outward the owner is compelled to knock before opening it in order to avoid injuring the passerby in the street there are no windows on the lower floor at the front of the house beside the door is a statue of hermes god of highways doorways and boundaries and the bringer of good luck or an altar to apollo god of light and the sun and the protector from all evil and over the door we may notice an inscription such as to the good genius followed by the name of the master of the house we raise the handle of the great knocker and scarcely has the sound echoed back to us when the door is opened by the porter we must be careful to step in with our right foot first as it is considered unlucky to cross the threshold with the left foot a long corridor or hall leads us to the open court where all is as beautiful as the exterior is plain usually a fountain and flowers brighten the marble court while on each side of it are the banqueting music sitting and sleeping rooms picture galleries and libraries but the greeks spent so much time out of doors that a house was to them only a safe place for their families and their property—a shelter from storm most of the houses had porticoes or porches and often the second story consisted of nothing but these porches around the open court the flat tiled roofs were used as promenades probably the greeks in our picture are seated on one of these porches or they may be in one of the summer pavilions which so many wealthy greeks had erected in their yards or grassy plots back of the house here they spent their afternoons and were entertained with music or by the tales of wandering minstrels or readers the scene in the picture is represented as if it were in the open air the column and stone wall behind the reader suggest a part of a house in the distance we catch a glimpse of the blue sea the slightly raised seat of the reader indicates that it is a place built expressly for this purpose before the greeks wrote their stories it was the custom of certain bards or readers to go about from place to place singing or reciting the stories of events which have made their national history even when the stories were written these bards were in great favor for the greeks preferred to hear the music of verse recited and to feel the thrill of enthusiasm which could be aroused by the human voice and not by a lifeless tablet or book the swaying form of the reader his rapt expression his flashing eye his musical voice rising and falling like the sea—these were the result of inspiration and had power to arouse men to noble actions in our picture we see such a reader giving an interpretation or reading much as our best elocutionists do now in his hand he holds a long scroll from which he reads the greeks used the egyptian papyrus and later the more expensive but finer parchment to write upon the reed pen was used and double inkstands for black and red ink which could be fastened to the belts or girdles of the writers in libraries the scrolls were arranged on shelves with the ends outward or in pigeon holes the reader unrolled one end of the scroll with one hand while with the other he rolled up the part he had read of all the greek stories none were more fascinating than those of the immortal homer according to tradition homer was a schoolmaster who growing tired of teaching began to travel wandering about from place to place he finally became blind after this great affliction came upon him he returned to his native town where he dictated his two great poems the iliad and the odyssey afterwards he wandered about from town to town singing them and adding to them as inspiration came it is not even known where he was born but according to an old greek epigram seven rival towns contend for homer dead through which the living homer begged his bread he was a beggar and yet he was a welcome guest at every home for he could play upon his fourstringed harp and sing of the wonderful deeds of the greek gods and heroes the subject of homers iliad is the story of the siege of troy in a contest between aphrodite venus and two other goddesses aphrodite the goddess of love and beauty had promised paris son of the king of troy that if he would declare her the most beautiful of the goddesses he should have for his wife the handsomest woman of his time helen wife of the king of sparta paris granted her request and going to sparta with aphrodites aid he carried off helen to troy of course her husband the king of sparta objected he appealed to all the grecian princes to help him and soon a hundred thousand men sailed away in eleven hundred and eightysix ships across the ægean sea and camped before the walls of troy the siege lasted ten years troy was finally taken by stratagem the greeks pretended to abandon the siege leaving behind them a great wooden horse as an offering to athena minerva goddess of wisdom and the special defender of citadels the trojans could not find out their reason for building the monster but while they were talking about it and gazing at it some shepherds brought into the town a young greek named sinon whom they had captured he told a pitiful story he said the greek leader hated him and had induced the greek soothsayer to declare that he must be put to death as a sacrifice for their safe return to greece he had escaped and hidden in a swamp until the greeks had gone the trojans were ready to be kind to any man whom the greeks hated and he was set free at once but tell us said the king why that monster of a horse was built sinon declared it was a sacrifice to athena because she was angry with them he said it was made too large to pass through your gates for they knew that if it was once within your walls it would protect you and victory would come to you instead of to the greeks the trojans believed every word of this and ordered the huge horse brought within their city even though they were obliged to take down part of the wall in order to make the opening large enough that night the treacherous sinon opened a door in the body of the horse and let out the armed greeks who were hidden inside they quietly slipped to the ground by means of a rope killed the watchmen and opened the gates to the greek army which had returned and was waiting outside a terrible battle followed in which nearly all the trojans were killed helen was taken back to greece in homers odyssey he tells the adventures of ulysses king of ithaca during the return journey from troy ulysses had been one of the bravest of the greek leaders and was one of the heroes concealed in the wooden horse the poem is full of vivid description and noble sentiments both pathetic and sublime and it stirred the hearts of the greeks with pride and joy it is easy to see the interest in the faces of the listeners in the picture partly robed in a rosecolored garment the reader sits on a chair of marble holding on his knees a roll of papyrus from which he is reading to a group of four persons before him a wreath of bay leaves crowns his head and as he leans forward his face expresses enthusiasm while he tells the thrilling adventures of the hero of homers story in the center of the background we see a woman on her hair is a crown of daffodils and in her left hand something resembling a tambourine she half sits half reclines on a marble bench a resting place which the greeks always preferred to chairs on the floor near her in an attitude of careless ease sits a young man who is very likely her lover since he is holding her hand his face expresses his interest in the story in his right hand he holds a lyre which suggests that the company has been listening to music and that they will enjoy it again after this recital how intent their faces are as they follow in imagination all the adventures of their sturdy ancestors near the center of the picture and stretched out gracefully on the marble floor is a youth who appears anxious not to lose one word of the story at the left we see a man standing he wears a crown of flowers on his head and wraps his long cloak closely about him his face is wild and sad his appearance seems to tell that he has duties elsewhere and ought to leave but is being held by the story the people are all dressed in typical greek costumes the dress of greek men and women was very much alike when they appeared on the streets they wore a cloak which consisted of a large square piece of cloth so wrapped about them as to leave only the right arm free it required much skill to drape it gracefully and the manner in which this was done decided the taste and elegance of the wearer the women and men of the higher classes wore what they called a chiton or dress which consisted of two short pieces of cloth sewed or clasped together and fastened over the shoulder leaving open spaces for the arms it was fastened at the waist with a girdle a man usually wore this chiton although he was considered fully dressed in the cloak alone it was the lower classes who wore the tanned skins so the young man lying on the floor is probably a servant a touch of bright color is added to this picture by the flowers in the girls hair and those scattered on the bench beside her the flesh painting in this picture is claimed to be the most perfect that almatadema ever did and the painting of the girl and her lover one of his highest efforts the reader is the center of interest in the picture the light the lines and the position of the figures make this apparent the painting of these five large figures occupied the artist only eight weeks but the preliminary studies before he began painting took eight months almatadema excelled in his painting of marble and this picture gave him every opportunity to display his genius since nearly the entire background is of marble the delicate colors of the young girls costume with the few bright touches of color in the flowers the darker richer colors of the mens cloaks and back of it all the clear opalescent colors of marble and the deep blue of the sea beyond give the picture a distinctive beauty which is most pleasing to the eye a close student of greek history almatadema has been particular to see that every little detail is in harmony and consistent with the age and country questions to help the pupil understand the picture what is the center of interest in this picture what lines in the picture direct your eye to the reader how does the light do this the position of the figures tell something of greek life of homer of the siege of troy why did it take the artist eight months to get ready to paint this picture to the teacher each pupil may be asked to draw one greek ornament from some history encyclopedia or dictionary subjects for compositions a day in a greek home a greek library homer and his writings a description of a reading from homer the artist the story of the artist sir lawrence almatadema of dutch parentage was born in the little village of dronrijp near leewarden the netherlands in the year 1836 when he was very young his father died leaving his mother with a large family and small means and it was decided from the first that almatadema must learn a good trade or profession his progress at school caused his mother much anxiety for the boy cared for nothing except roman history which he began to study by himself having secured some quaint old coins in the neighborhood he spent much of his time copying the heads of the emperors on the coins he soon began to show remarkable talent for painting a portrait which he painted of his sister was exhibited when he was only fifteen years old but his mother wished him to become a lawyer because she felt it would bring the best financial returns he tried to please her but a serious illness was the result when the doctor advised the mother to let him become an artist she gave her consent and it is said the boy recovered with astonishing rapidity he studied at antwerp many years winning such success that he sent for his mother and sister to come to live with him then he began to make a special study of egypt greece and rome after his marriage to an english lady he moved to london where he lived the rest of his life his love for marble and the polished surfaces of bronze gold and other metals is clearly shown in most of his pictures even his portraits usually represent the sitter as glancing in a mirror or in some way reflected in it perhaps no other artist has ever made so much use of flowers in his pictures the flowers seem to add the one touch of bright color which beautifies the whole picture almatadema gives us a clear understanding of the home life of the greeks and romans and so has become known as the painter of the ancients almatadema became a british subject in 1873 his home in st johns wood in the northwest part of london is described as a most interesting place the first glimpse of it seen through the trees shows the gilded weather vane in the form of a palette later the stone pillars of the roman porch in all its details the house is carefully and beautifully furnished the brass knocker on the door the entrance into a sort of sun parlor paved with tiles and bright with beautiful flowers and the sound of a fountain near at hand a flight of marble steps leads to a hall in which beautiful painted panels the gifts of friends are the chief decoration great tiger skins cover the floor mrs tadema also is an artist and has her studio on this floor in her studio and the living rooms she has given full sway to her own fancy for the sixteenthcentury old dutch most of their contents having been brought from the netherlands almatademas taste is purely classical and his studio is consistent in all respects—marble pillars carved woodwork chairs and cushions here he lived and worked with this motto before him as the sun colours flowers so art colours life questions about the artist of what nationality was the artist why was his mother so anxious to have him learn a trade or profession what did he like to study what picture did he exhibit when he was fifteen years old what prevented his becoming a lawyer what countries did he prefer to represent what materials did he excel in painting for what has he become famous illustration the golden stairs the golden stairs questions to arouse interest what does this picture represent what is there unusual about this stairway why do you suppose burnejones painted the stairs without a railing what is there unusual about these figures what are they carrying in their hands where are they going where did they come from do they seem to be standing still or moving what makes you think so are they noisy or quiet in their movements why do you think so why has the leader raised her hand what can you see in the window above the stairs is this a sad or a happy procession why do you think so what do you like best about this picture original picture private collection of lord battersea england artist sir edward burnejones bûrnjōnz birthplace birmingham england dates born 1833 died 1898 the story of the picture the artist burnejones was a student and a dreamer as a small motherless boy he had been left much alone in a home in which storybooks were considered wicked so there were none for him to read his father was a strong churchman and intended his son for the ministry he was endeavoring as best he knew how to fit him for his high calling by a training which though perfectly sincere and honest in purpose was rather gloomy and severe for the delicate sensitive boy however little edward was naturally of an imaginative mind so he made up his own stories a relative sent him a copy of æsops fables and this book he was permitted to keep it seems to have brought the turning point in the boys life from that time on he dwelt in a fairyland of his own making when he was sent away to school to prepare for the ministry he carried his fancies with him adding to them the many legends of greek mythology of literature especially those wonderful stories of king arthurs court and of the bible his desire to become an artist was aroused by another student william morris the two spending all their spare time drawing and painting nevertheless he was twentythree years old before he saw any of the great masterpieces in painting from the very first burnejones chose subjects which were mysterious fairylike and unreal but his pictures were so filled with music beauty and happiness that it was a delight to look at them his idea of a good picture was very different from that of the practical painstaking millet who represented everything and everybody as they actually appeared before him in the very field or place he had found them burnejones tells us i mean by a picture a beautiful romantic dream of something that never was never will be in a light better than any light that has ever shone in a land no one can define or remember only dream and so when asked to paint a decoration for a hallway in one of the fine old london homes he thought at once of a stairway and the painting of the golden stairs is the result it would seem indeed a dream this angel host descending from we know not where and halting at that mysterious closed door which leads we know not whither but hush the leader has half raised her hand turning this way as if to ask for silence each figure stops instantly holding herself motionless while the musical instruments are slightly lowered that all may listen more intently and yet this is a joyous procession—the gayly colored wreaths of flowers which most of them are wearing the musical instruments the happy faces all tell us this is an errand of pleasure might it not be that this host of angels is descending upon the sleeping world to soothe the restless worried ones and smooth the puckered aching brows in quiet slumber lulled by their gentle music or the rustle of their approaching footsteps the weary one would soon find refreshing sleep the light in the picture seems to come from above yet is all about and around the figures as if they were the source of the illumination they come from a darkened doorway and enter one quite as dark except for the light they bring to it the greater part of the picture is painted in shades of gray but it is relieved by the flesh tints and the gayly colored flowers worn in wreaths or scattered on the steps here is delicate exquisite coloring and figures drawn with such careful attention to details that each seems complete in itself yet all are held together in one great harmony it is interesting to draw an oblong of this same proportion and then represent the curved lines in this picture it makes us feel the movement swing and rhythm which come to us like approaching music the picture is full of idyllic charm which takes us away from all the prosaic details of everyday life to a fairyland where this happy throng may come and go with music flowers and delight the calm thoughtful faces so full of kindly purpose and high ideals cannot fail to inspire us with good thoughts the dove in the upper casement window is typical of the peace that pervades this scene the faint far from earthly shadows the bare feet even the stairway without a railing or protection of any kind all suggest that our youthful maidens are celestial beings their destination we can only guess perhaps that is why the picture has had several names the kings wedding music on the stairs and the one by which it is now known the golden stairs burnejones made many beautiful designs for stainedglass windows and we can but regret that he did not produce this picture in that way also questions to help the pupil understand the picture tell about the boyhood and early training of the artist what book influenced him most how did it affect his choice of subjects to paint how did he happen to become interested in art how old was he before he first saw a great painting compare the subjects chosen by burnejones and by millet as to character and feeling what was burnejoness idea of a good picture how did he happen to paint the golden stairs for what room was it intended what colors did the artist use in this painting in what ways does it suggest music how would you explain the destination of these maidens their errand from whence they come what would you consider the chief charm in the picture the story of the artist we have heard how the small burnejones was brought up by a rather strict but ambitious father and perhaps have felt sorry for the boy who used to spend hours before the windows of a book store gazing at the even rows of books with such wistful longing but we need not feel so for it was this very desire for books and stories that led him to use his own imaginative power when he was old enough to begin serious preparation for the ministry his father sent him to king edwards school here he earned a scholarship to oxford when he left home for oxford it seemed as if his real life had begun for it was here that he met friends who had the same tastes and longings as himself one friend in particular william morris shared with him his newfound delight in art both had intended to prepare for the ministry but now they decided to give up all else and pursue the study of art so at the age of twentythree burnejones left oxford and went to london where he began painting in earnest from the very first he showed great originality both in his subjects and in his manner of representation many of his subjects were taken from the bible from greek mythology or from stories of king arthurs court sometimes he painted with but the one idea of making something beautiful as in this picture of the golden stairs burnejones was fortunate in his first teacher rossetti who was a man so filled with the beauty of a scene that he must paint it for sheer joy in order to pay for this instruction burnejones made designs for stainedglass windows and became famous for the beauty of these windows the one at trinity church boston is called david instructing solomon in the building of the temple at oxford is the famous saint cecilia window he designed for christ church college it seems strange that burnejones should wait until he grew to manhood before he discovered that he had the desire and the ability to draw other artists tell of the years spent in longing and their constant struggle for the sake of their art but when burnejones made up his mind he spent no time in experiment or even practice he devoted all his time to the one idea which filled his thoughts he made no effort whatever to find out whether his work would meet with popular favor or not beginning at once with what he knew to be his right material the only difference to be noticed in his first and his last paintings was a difference in the speed and skill with which he handled the paints new ideas occurred to him so rapidly that he formed the habit of making quick sketches and putting them aside until he had time to work them out carefully burnejones had never rebelled against the profession his father chose for him indeed he felt satisfied and made every effort to succeed in it perhaps if he had remained at home or even if he had not met the enthusiastic william morris just when he did he might never have discovered his power as a painter the knowledge of the disappointment at home and the small means at his disposal did not hinder him from forsaking the profession his family had chosen for him for was he not following the advice of the great painter rossetti not many young artists have found such a friend as rossetti was to burnejones he not only gave the desired instruction but helped his pupil get such work as he was capable of doing when the glass makers applied to rossetti for a design for a stainedglass window he declined to undertake the work but recommended his pupil instead a visit to italy gave burnejones new inspiration later when william morris married and went to live in a house which had been built for him at bexley heath he had difficulty in furnishing this house to suit his taste and desire for beautiful things this led morris to establish a firm to make such things of course burnejones was heartily in sympathy with his friend and put his talents as a designer at the disposal of the firm his wonderful imagination and fine powers of expression produced all kinds of decorative work such as tapestries embroideries carved chests book covers book illustrations and decorations for pianos screens and friezes although he received so much praise in his later years at first he too had to pass through the fire of criticism and even ridicule at one time burnejones was ridiculed in the pages of punch while in another magazine he was spoken of as the greeneryyallery grosvenorgallery young man but these criticisms were soon forgotten and all england was proud to honor this artist with medals in 1894 burnejones was given the title of baronet questions about the artist tell about the boyhood of burnejones his education what kind of subjects did he choose for his paintings what was his idea of a good painting who was his first teacher why did he wait so long before he began to study painting what can you say of his imagination tell about william morris and his new home what did burnejones do for his friend illustation aurora aurora questions to arouse interest what goddess does this represent whom is she leading upon what do they rest over what are they passing what has aurora in her hands toward whom is she looking in what is apollo riding how many horses has he what has the cherub in his hand which way does the flame blow why what makes you think they are moving in what direction do their garments blow who painted this picture why do you like it original picture pavilion of the rospigliosi palace rome italy artist guido reni gwēdō rānē birthplace bologna italy dates born 1575 died 1642 the story of the picture imagine yourself in that farfamed city of rome driving through its white streets to the great quirinal palace to see the original of our picture the quirinal a very large and very ordinary looking building has been the scene of many interesting events and is always used as the meeting place for the cardinals who elect the pope our drive ends here but it is only the beginning of our journey after a delightful walk through a courtyard so completely surrounded by high stone walls that we should never have guessed its existence we come to another palace this palace is much more beautiful although not so large it is called the rospigliosi palace because it has always belonged to a family of that name then we pass on through a beautiful garden of magnolias until we reach the pavilion or casino of the palace where we find our picture there are several rooms in this pavilion but it is the middle room which holds our attention for it is up on the ceiling of this room that we see aurora goddess of the morning leading the way for the fiery steeds of apollo the sun god as we enter such a glow of color fills the room that we know instinctively this must be the place first we see aurora herself flying ahead scattering the clouds of night and showering roses and dewdrops over the sleeping earth she looks back toward apollo the sun god to see if he is following her on his journey around the heavens in his chariot of the sun the horses are restless and eager and it takes a steady hand to guide them some idea of the difficulties attending such a journey may be gained from the greek story of phaëthon according to this story apollo had a son named phaëthon one day the boy came to him complaining that the other boys made fun of him when he told them who his father was they said they did not believe that a boy who could do nothing at all could be the son of the mighty apollo this made the father very angry and when phaëthon asked him to let him do something that should prove to the world that he was apollos son apollo told the boy he would give him permission to do whatever he asked the boy quickly asked permission to drive the sun chariot for one day but this request alarmed apollo who said none but myself may drive the flaming car of day—not even jupiter whose terrible right arm drives the thunderbolts he urged his son to take back his request before it was too late warning him it would prove his destruction but the boy was only the more anxious to drive and held his father to his promise then apollo told phaëthon of the journey the first part of the way he said is so very steep that although the horses start out in the best possible condition they can hardly climb it the next part is so high up in the heavens that i dare not look down upon the earth and sea below lest i grow dizzy and fall the last part of the journey is the most difficult of all because the road descends rapidly and it is hard to guide the horses and all this time apollo went on the heavens are turning around and carrying the stars with them but even as he spoke aurora threw open the cloud curtains which hid the earth and there appeared the road upon which she cast her roses while beckoning to the eager boy hardly listening to his fathers anxious warnings phaëthon jumped into the golden chariot grasped the reins of the four fiery steeds and off they started at first he remembered what apollo had said and was careful but he soon grew reckless driving at full speed the horses knowing it was not their masters hand took the bits between their teeth and were soon out of his control for a time they followed the road but when that was lost they began to descend toward the earth so rapidly it seemed as if they would be dashed to pieces then up again they started in reckless dizzy flight at times they came so close to fields and woods as to scorch and blacken them other fields they did not pass and these were frostbitten then a great wail of complaint went up from the earth this cry was heard by jupiter the most powerful of the gods who looking earthward and discovering the cause of all this trouble was very angry with his terrible right arm he drove a thunderbolt at the reckless youth and in an instant phaëthon fell from the chariot headlong into the sea the horses finding themselves free returned to apollo and never since then has any hand but his been permitted to guide them the greeks declared that the great desert of sahara in africa is the place where the suns chariot scorched the earth and that it was then that the african negroes were burned black phaëthons boy friend who was constantly diving down into the water trying to recover his body was turned into a swan and phaëthons weeping sisters were changed into poplar trees in our picture we see apollo holding the reins accompanied by the hours and preceded by aurora and the cherub torchbearer or morning star they seem to be moving rapidly on their way borne up by the clouds the sky is a brilliant golden yellow and its fleecy clouds are tinged with purple the graceful figures of the hours are each represented in pale or brightercolored draperies according to the time of day to which they belong aurora herself is clothed in rainbow hues her draperies flying with her swift progress far below we see the land and sea wrapped in slumber awaiting the coming of the dawn questions to help the pupil understand the picture where is the original painting of the aurora what goddess does it represent what is the greek myth concerning her what part has apollo in this picture how many horses does he drive how are the hours represented what does the cherub carrying a torch represent in what direction does the flame of the torch blow why is apollos journey so difficult who was phaëthon what did he ask of apollo why did he wish to do this why was apollo alarmed tell about phaëthons journey and what happened to him upon what does the chariot seem to rest over what are they passing what colors did the artist use in this painting to the teacher subjects for compositions aurora goddess of the morning apollo the sun god the story of phaëthon apollos son the story of the artist guido reni was born in the little village of bologna italy as a small child he gave every promise of becoming an accomplished musician his father himself a gifted performer began to teach him to play the flute and harpsichord as soon as he was old enough to handle the instruments guido had a beautiful voice and the father hoped to make a fine musician of him but the boy also had a beautiful sunshiny face which attracted the attention of an artist who asked permission to paint him as an angel in several pictures after watching this artist at work guido began to wish to paint pictures too and was permitted to take a few lessons his first picture was a surprise to the artist causing him to urge guidos father to allow the boy to develop his talent about this time too guido began to make all kinds of interesting figures in clay and his fingers were always busy at thirteen years of age he so excelled the other pupils of the artist that he was allowed to teach some of them later guido went to rome where he remained for twenty years in great favor he then moved to bologna and there opened a large school for art students he made his home in bologna during the rest of his life guido reni might have lived all his life in splendor and ease for he earned great sums of money but as his fame grew he became more and more extravagant in his habits and so was always in debt he was obliged to paint hurriedly and to the utmost of his genius that he might have more pictures to sell however his keen sense of beauty did not desert him and his popularity continued to the end he was especially skillful in representing beautiful upraised faces of women and children one day a young nobleman met guido reni and asked him where he found such lovely models for his paintings he said the other artists were wondering about it and thought him very selfish to keep them to himself guido replied in a mysterious voice come to my studio signor and i will show you my beautiful model so filled with delight and eager anticipation the nobleman tiptoed after the artist up the stairs to the studio you can imagine how he must have felt when guido reni called his colorgrinder who has been described as a great greasy fellow with a brutal look and posed him as the colorgrinder sat quietly looking up through the skylight guido took a pencil and after sketching very rapidly for a few minutes showed his guest a sketch of a beautiful magdalen gazing upward then turning to his visitor he said earnestly dear count say to your ‘other artists that a beautiful idea must be in the imagination and in that case any model will serve guido reni had the greatest admiration for the paintings of raphael and went to rome just to study them as he loved to work with clay himself he spent much of his time in rome studying the beautiful pieces of statuary there he tells us that his favorites were the venus de medici and niobe pleasant and courteous to all he made friends everywhere and was greatly beloved once when he was very ill his friends hired musicians to play just outside his door this pleased him greatly as he was always passionately fond of music he said to them and what then will be the melodies of paradise guido reni was a great favorite of pope paul v and many of his pictures were painted for the pope when he returned from rome to bologna he found himself more popular than ever and quite overwhelmed with orders for pictures of all his paintings the aurora is generally considered his best the story is told of a little girl who had lived all her life in the country upon her first visit to her uncle in the city she discovered a large and splendid copy of the aurora in his living room one morning her uncle came into the room and found his little niece gazing at the picture in rapt admiration well mary he said what do you think of it oh uncle she replied i like it ‘cause they are in such a hurry so young and old have found one reason or another for liking this picture guido reni painted many portraits as well as many historical and mythological pictures some of the best known of guidos paintings are reclining venus with cupid st michael and the dragon beatrice cenci little bacchus drinking and the mater dolorosa of solimena questions about the artist where was the artist born what two talents had he how did he happen to study painting how did he succeed with his first picture what was his progress why was he never rich what subjects did he choose what did the young nobleman ask him tell of the noblemans visit to the artists studio whose paintings did guido reni admire greatly what statues how was he able to make so many friends what was his

important part of this picture describe the trees bordering the road where does the road lead what does it pass on its way to the village where must the artist have been standing why do you think so

so level what are the people in the picture doing what do you like best about this picture original picture national gallery london england artist meyndert hobbema hŏbĕ mä birthplace amsterdam the netherlands dates born 1638 died 1709 the story of the picture there is a little village in the netherlands by the name of middelharnis and if we should go there today we should find just such an avenue of trees as this one in our picture the artist hobbema spent many years in this village painting scenes in and around it probably he traveled over this very road countless times it would seem as if we too were walking down the road guarded by those tall slender trees which border each side of it they are poplar trees trimmed so high that we scarcely recognize them they lead direct to the little village beyond which we see between the tree trunks since the village is almost surrounded by the north sea its high church tower is not only picturesque by day but useful at night as a lighthouse or beacon to guide the sailor to a safe port in our picture the sun is half hidden in a sky as full of fleecy clouds as the sky near the north sea generally is we must expect no hills nor elevations of any kind in the netherlands a land lying lower than the ocean the great protecting dikes and the many canals extending in every direction make it one of the most interesting of countries in the picture we see on each side of the road a deep ditch full of water these ditches irrigate the land flowing into deeper wider canals on which sail boats of various sizes and kinds it is said that every true hollander can skate in the winter when these canals are frozen young and old go about upon their various errands on skates it is a common sight then to see women skating to market carrying upon their heads heavy baskets filled with rolls of butter cheese eggs or other provisions the children skate to school and men go about their business in this same pleasant way it is easy to reach all parts of the village or city by these canals for there are so many of them in some cities the people have no streets but use canals instead at the right of our picture we catch a glimpse of a thrifty wellkept nursery garden full of shrubs and fruit trees which the man is busily trimming he works contentedly for all about him he sees the evidences of prosperity and peace coming toward us along this straight and level road is a huntsman carrying his gun over his shoulder and preceded by his dog a path leads away from the road to the picturesque little cottage or farmhouse at the right two peasants a man and a woman stand in the path talking we do not doubt they will turn to greet our hunter for it is a friendly countryside where all are treated cordially we cannot see much on the extreme left of the picture except the trees which grow luxuriantly and a flat meadow land which reaches almost to the village it is a common everyday sort of landscape yet its charm seems to lie in this very fact we would know at once if the perspective were not correct for we have solved just such problems ourselves with the tree tops or perhaps telegraph poles and it gives us an added sense of pleasure to be able to understand just the problem hobbema had to solve as he placed his easel in the middle of the road and started to paint his great canvas the light is rather uncertain on this cloudy day the artist used little color except grays and a peculiar green which he delighted in using in all his paintings a touch of brighter color appears in the cheerful red of the roofs of his houses which suggest something of the homely comfort and cleanliness that may be found in most dutch homes the most striking characteristic of hobbemas painting is his severe combination of vertical and horizontal lines the positive vertical lines of the tree trunks standing so tall and straight against the wide expanse of sky are reëchoed in the shorter but equally slender trunks of the fruit trees in the nursery garden and of the trees at the side of the path leading to the farmhouse also in the two straight figures standing in the path and again in the church tower in the distance the horizontal lines are equally positive they separate the garden from the road they appear in the road itself and in the horizon line beyond if we make a sketch of the important lines in this picture we find them either vertical or horizontal and much more severe in outline than the usual diagonal or curving lines we have grown accustomed to looking for critics seem to vary as to the feeling with which this picture inspires them although all agree upon its value as a masterpiece some declare there is a sort of hopelessness in the landscape which suggests the unhappy life of the artist who often went hungry and whose paintings were not appreciated until after his death to them the scene is full of hopeless beauty suggesting all kinds of joys which are never realized yet continue just out of reach throughout a long and cheerless life so it is a sad beauty and gives one a feeling of desolation even in a land where all is prosperity other critics see only the thrifty contented life of the netherlands peasant who by his intelligence and labor has overcome even the sea itself and compelled it by means of dikes and canals to add to his safety and comfort we know how much hobbema must have loved his work for he received no return for it during his lifetime unless it was the joy of work and yet he persevered can we not imagine him on a pleasant day seated or standing at his easel in the middle of this road quite forgetting poverty and even hunger as he painted this beautiful landscape before him hobbema was certainly daring and full of courage when he attempted so severe and unusual a composition as this he has placed his road almost exactly in the center of the picture balancing the sides quite evenly yet he has not made it monotonous or tiresome the eye is constantly discovering new beauties in the landscape or the inclosing sky only a master could produce a work such as this questions to help the pupil understand the picture what country is represented in this picture what kind of trees are those bordering the road to what do they lead the eye of what use could the church tower in the distance be why is the netherlands such a level country what can you see on each side of the road of what use are the canals what is the man doing in the garden who else can you see in the picture what colors did the artist use how can you tell whether the perspective of the road is correct or not what can you say of the sky what can you say of the balance in the composition the kinds of lines what kind of a day is represented what do some of the critics say about this picture what is so unusual about this composition why do most artists avoid placing the center of interest in the middle of the picture why do you like this picture the story of the artist we know very little about the artist meyndert hobbema except that he was a hollander possessing so great a love for his native land that he continued to represent it on canvas in spite of the fact that his countrymen were quite indifferent to him and his work his pictures were disposed of somehow perhaps given away for when a hundred years after his death the world suddenly began to value them it was found that he had left enough canvases to have made him the wealthiest man in the country yet he died in the almshouse and was buried beside his wife in a paupers grave now all the netherlands would give him honor but so neglected was he during his life that it is impossible to find out even where he was born three cities claim this honor but it is generally conceded that he was born at amsterdam it is certain he was married and died there we determine the date of his birth by the date and his age as given in the record of his marriage hobbemas paintings were so real that the people who were used to more fanciful idealized pictures thought his commonplace and of no especial interest now they recognize the great sympathy with and insight into the very life of their country which hobbema possessed in rare measure he made it real to us too in his scenes of thrift and industry prosperity and smiling peace we are told that hobbema was a plain practical matteroffact man and his pictures make us think he must have been like him they are plain unassuming and natural free from artificial grace or fancy he did not hunt for scenes of unusual beauty with romantic or weird stories but chose some pleasing view near at hand and painted it just as it was sometimes he painted the same scene several times from exactly the same position if all his works could be placed in one gallery for exhibition we might find it rather monotonous to see so many just alike but although he did not have the inventive genius of burnejones or of many other artists his paintings were always true to nature he has been called the painter of the afternoon sun because he seemed so fond of the sunlight showing through the trees and casting long shadows across the fields many believe that hobbema must have been a pupil of ruysdaels because their work was so much alike we know that they lived in the same place at the same time and it is generally believed they were friends dealers often substituted the name of one for that of the other and later when corrections were attempted it was impossible to tell which was hobbemas work and which ruysdaels because both had painted the same subjects at one time hobbema was appointed gauger for the town it was his duty to measure the quantity of all liquids imported into holland this position must have paid a fairly good salary for hobbema was married directly after his appointment it must have taken all his time too for he painted very little for nearly twenty years the fact that he had a means of livelihood did not spur him on to greater efforts he painted only when he felt like it not very often and small unimportant pictures whether he lost this office before or after his wifes death is not known but for some reason or other his last years were spent in extreme poverty twentysix years after his death his pictures began to sell and soon picture dealers were scouring the country for his works his landscapes are not full of people animals or anything that might disturb the calm quiet restfulness of the scenes like ruysdael he too was compelled to call upon other artists to draw the few figures he did use as he found this part most difficult one thing we may be sure of when we look at his paintings and that is they were faithful representations of the place before him so we may know just how this road leading to the village of middelharnis really looked more than two centuries ago other famous paintings by hobbema are entitled showery weather village with water mills woody landscape ruins of brederode castle forest scene cottage in a wood and entrance to a wood questions about the artist what kind of a man do you think hobbema must have been why in what ways do his pictures resemble him what kind of pictures did he like to paint what time of day why might an exhibition of all his paintings prove monotonous what would you consider one of the best things about his paintings what other great artist lived at this time and in the same place how did their paintings resemble each other what office did hobbema hold what were some of his duties how did this position affect his work what became of his paintings why was he so poor why were his paintings not appreciated how are they regarded now why do you think hobbema must have loved his work illustration the angelus by permission of

background from what direction does the light come what time of day do you think it is in what country why have they stopped their work who of you can tell what the angelus is what feeling does this picture give you—one of sadness peace quiet noise prosperity poverty or happiness original picture collection chauchard paris artist jean françois millet mē´lĕ birthplace gruchy france dates born 1814 died 1875 the story of the picture although our print is only black and white we are made to feel the brightness of the sunset in this picture the horizon veiled in a haze shows the church tower of the distant village faintly silhouetted against the sky while the sinking sun casts its long shadows across the field but our eyes do not dwell long on sky church or field for the two figures draw our gaze the bright rays from the setting sun fall directly upon the woman who faces the west the man turning toward her is partly in shadow no doubt these two peasants have been working in the fields the man digging potatoes as we may judge by those in the basket and the two wellfilled bags on the wheelbarrow as he digs them the woman gathers them up in her basket and empties them into the sacks thus busily engaged they suddenly hear the church bell its great tone coming far across the field reminds them that it is the hour of prayer so putting down the pitchfork and basket they stand with bowed heads as they repeat the evening prayer the artist wished to paint a picture that would make us hear the bell sounding clearly across the deep stillness of the open field he wished to make us feel as do these peasants the quiet solemnity of the hour even as a little boy millet was greatly impressed by the sound of the angelus or bell for prayers which was rung each morning noon and night one of his earliest remembrances was of a time when the villagers bought new bells for the church and he went with his mother and a neighbor to see them before they were hung it seems that two of the old bells had been used to make a cannon the third was broken and these new bells were in the church waiting to be baptized before they could be hung in the tower they seemed immense to the small boy and of course they must have been larger than he millet tells of the delight and awe he felt when the neighbor struck the bells with the great key to the church door which she carried in her hand no wonder then that this picture was one of millets favorites for it reminded him of his boyhood home and brought back memories of the thoughts and experiences of his childhood grown to manhood and himself a peasant he too had heard the angelus sounded forth from the village church tower and had dropped his work to bow his head in prayer the quiet and peace of such moments had left a deep impression which he wished to share with us the long stretch of field suggests the industry of the peasants the distant church and their bowed heads against the bright sky tell us of their faith can you not see them on their homeward journey the man pushing the wheelbarrow with its heavy load while the woman carries the basket it looks as if it would be a long tiresome tramp across the uneven field to the village so dimly visible in the distance this is the time of year when the peasants work is hardest for during the winter there is little farm work to do we are told that the women spend their winter days in spinning weaving cloth and making clothes while the men weave baskets make their garden tools and do what little work there is to do the very simplicity of this landscape with its lack of details is part of its great charm the quiet dignity of the man and woman standing with bowed heads the peace and quiet of the scene and above all the sound of the sweettoned angelus give us a feeling of restfulness and peace the horizon line is high in this picture yet the sky space is large enough to contain the heads and shoulders of our two peasants in this way we are made to feel that although they are bound to earth and are a part of it their thoughts soar higher there is another life besides the one of toil and privation at the time millet painted this great picture he was wretchedly poor he sent the picture to a friend in paris begging him to sell it and send the money as soon as possible it sold for less than five hundred dollars yet not many years ago a french collector paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this same picture the angelus they stand within the field at prayer the rustic man and maid while silvery thro the amber air the angels song is played they bow their heads in gratitude for gift of life and health and for content—their highest good and love—their only wealth there is a closeness to the soil in both their garb and mien that tells of happiness and toil and quiet peace serene a lark above them sings and sings a song of hope and youth theirs is the joy of common things— the beauty of the truth —edward wilbur mason questions to help the pupil understand the picture what time of day does this picture represent what can you see in the distance in what direction is the woman facing how can you tell what have these peasants been doing why have they stopped their work why is the picture called the angelus tell about millet and the new bells for the church tell something of the life of these peasants how did the artist millet know so much about their life what can you say about the composition of this picture what was the financial condition of the artist when he painted this picture what did he do with this painting about how much is it worth now the story of the artist let us try to imagine the artist jean françois millet as a young man nineteen years old on his first visit to the great city of paris brought up on a farm among the lowliest of the french peasants he had met few except those with whom he labored in the fields or those who poorer than they were made welcome under the ever hospitable roof of the elder millets these neighbors and friends were mostly sailors or farmers who looked upon the journey to paris as a great event as indeed it was for weeks the kind old grandmother had kept her spinning wheel busy spinning and weaving the cloth for his new suit of clothes she was the tailor who cut stitched and pressed them all her savings of years had been sewed into a belt and given to him for this journey as he stood in the doorway waiting for the old stagecoach which presently came rattling down the stone road of the village he must have felt anew the great sacrifices they were all so willing to make to send him where he could study his beloved art in paris millet presented an unusual appearance—six feet in height slender a downy beard on his face his brown hair hanging to his shoulders all his belongings were neatly packed in the sailors canvas bag which he carried over his shoulder is it any wonder that many did not see the straightforward honest manly look of the calm gray eyes there was in that gaze and in the rude bearing a certain quiet confidence and strength which only the home folks recognized and valued the boy could draw and draw well they knew and had not the drawing master of the village told them he would surely one day become a great artist tired from the three days ride in the old stagecoach jostled by the hurrying crowds for it was evening and all were on their way home he stood confused a policeman catching sight of the stupidlooking youth blocking the sidewalk with his great bag asked him where he wanted to go is it any wonder that he answered back to gruchy we are told that he even inquired when the next coach left for gruchy but there was none until morning the policeman sent him to a boarding house of moderate prices and the next morning he started out to find the great art gallery of the louvre he had attempted to inquire the way at the boarding house but the boarders laughed at his normandy accent and strange appearance and he did not wait for the answer and so he wandered the streets for three days not daring to ask the way for fear of being laughed at again until at last he stood before the great gallery recognizing it at once by the pictures he had seen of it in writing of it years later millet says my feelings were too great for words and i closed my eyes lest i be dazzled by the sight and then dared not open them lest i should find it all a dream and if i ever reach paradise i know my joy will be no greater than it was that first morning when i realized that i stood within the louvre palace in the meantime he had found a room and place to board near by the landlady having suggested that he had better not carry much money about with him he immediately gave her all he had to keep for him that was the last he saw of his money he spent a week just visiting the louvre and finally became acquainted with a student who was copying one of the paintings this student took him to the artist delaroche who after looking at his sketches gladly admitted him as a pupil the other students were greatly amused at millets awkward appearance and called him the man of the woods it was almost impossible to persuade him to talk and his answers to all questions were in monosyllables but if pressed too hard he could use his fists effectively they soon found out too that he could paint and paint well all idea of going home was given up and millet spent twelve years in paris enduring poverty and hunger but working faithfully and long when he went back to his home for a visit he was so nearly starved that he fell fainting on the ground when he tried to work in the fields millet painted landscapes portraits and signs but fortune never seemed to smile on him long at a time people said his pictures did not sell because he painted such common things and such poor people instead of choosing beautiful girls or fine gentlemen for his models but he painted the people he knew about and loved best—the french peasants—and as their lives were full of toil he must represent them at their labor returning to paris and finding his life there still one of continuous struggle with poverty millet with his wife and children went to live at barbizon a small village a days ride from paris many descriptions have been written and pictures painted of the modest white stone cottage with its clinging vines and its thrifty gardens in which he spent the rest of his life it was not until the last few years of his life that he ceased to be wretchedly poor for then at last his pictures were appreciated and he received the profit and honor that were his due he died at barbizon january 20 1875 questions about the artist tell about millets early training and the preparations made for his journey to paris how did he travel describe his first evening in paris how did he find the great gallery of the louvre why did he not inquire the way what became of his money with whom did he study and how did this happen what did the other students call him why did they do this how many years did he stay in paris what was his success there why did his pictures not sell where did he finally go to live when were his paintings appreciated illustration sheep in spring sheep in spring questions to arouse interest what is there in this picture that suggests the time of year what are the sheep doing how many have watched sheep eat grass why do the shepherd and his dog stand in front of them of what use is the shepherds crook or staff what do you see in the distance do you think this is a scene in our own country or in some foreign country how are the sheep farthest away represented where does the light fall upon the sheep and upon the man what kinds of lines are there in this picture tell some of the duties of a shepherd of a shepherds dog why do sheep need so much care of what use are they why do you like this picture original picture metropolitan museum new york city artist anton mauve mōv birthplace zaandam the netherlands dates born 1838 died 1888 the story of the picture the artist has taken us to his own native country showing us the beauties of the fields in spring and giving us much of their feeling of calm and contentment the shepherd has led his sheep safely past the freshly plowed field which we see at the left of the picture and now he stands in front of them so they will go more slowly and eat the grass closer if one of the sheep should go too fast he would probably reach out with his long crook which he would place around the sheeps neck and draw it back the dog too would do his part to keep it where it ought to be sheep prefer to run ahead taking a bit of grass here and a bit there but when they are held back by the man and dog as in this picture they will mow the grass as closely and thoroughly as if a lawnmower had passed over it as we look at the picture we find that though few details are shown the sheep in the first row are distinct while the rest are merely suggested anton mauve has become famous for this very thing—the omission of minor details in his pictures and the simplicity with which he thus tells his story we feel the warmth and vigor of this beautiful day in spring the fresh green grass with here and there a flower to relieve the green the soft green leaves of the young and slender trees planted on each side of the road at the right of the picture this road probably leads direct to the farmhouse we see in the distance the long meadow too seems to reach as far as that same farmhouse and no doubt will provide pasture all summer for the sheep their fleecy white wool will grow long then will come sheepshearing time and the wool will be sent away to be woven into cloth in the picture the light falls strongly upon the backs of the sheep on the head and shoulders of the man and on the wooden shoes he wears the dog stands there expectant ready to pursue any wayward sheep it is wonderful how much these shepherd dogs know and how much they help their owners in some countries the sheep are kept out in the fields or among the hills all night the shepherd rolls himself up in a blanket and sleeps securely near them knowing full well that the faithful dog will remain on guard allowing none to stray away or come to harm sometimes when the shepherd wishes to collect his flock and drive them to the fold or inclosure for the night many of them have wandered up into the mountains to almost inaccessible heights but the dog will find them every one he has a way of making the sheep understand what they are expected to do he circles around and around them so quickly that none can escape and he seems to have some mysterious way of counting them for if one is missing off he goes seldom failing to return with it the story is told of a shepherd who with but one dog was guarding seven hundred lambs at midnight they suddenly took fright and dividing into three sections disappeared over the hills the man could do nothing until daylight but the morning found the lambs gathered in a valley and guarded by the faithful dog from whose vigilance not one had escaped these intelligent shepherd dogs can be made to understand their masters wishes even at a great distance for they understand and obey motions made with the hands sheep are more helpless than most animals because they cannot defend themselves against wild animals and because having no sense of locality they are so easily lost or led astray if a flock of sheep is attacked by wolves and there are several dogs guarding the flock very often the dogs will circle around the sheep until they have crowded them as close together as they can then one of the dogs will continue walking around them while the others attack and usually beat off the wolves illustration sheep in autumn anton mauve has painted a companion picture to this one the two pictures hang on the same wall in the metropolitan museum new york city the companion picture is called sheep in autumn and as the name suggests it represents a scene in the fall of the year the first picture brings to our mind visions of green meadows newly ploughed fields tender grass and tiny green leaves quickening into life and beauty with the arrival of the mild days of spring but the second picture has a different story to tell it is autumn now the leaves and grass have ripened to a reddish brown and the grain has been gathered from the field at the right of the picture the sheep are turned away from us here and it is not necessary for the shepherd and his dog to hold them back there is no young and tender grass to tempt them and they are going home there are many young lambs with the flock now born since their mothers went out to pasture and they lag behind the rest as if the journey were a long one we can almost hear the shrill bleating of the little lambs mingled with the deeper calls of the sheep as they move along the road the shepherd this time an old man in the autumn of his life tenderly carries a little weak lamb under his arm perhaps after it has rested he will take up another tired one the dog looks older too no doubt he has had a hard summer of it with the care of all these sheep and their lambs by the long shadows mauve has told us that it is the end of the day as well as the end of the year there is a strong appeal in this picture when we think of the homecoming of this little company—the tired young lambs following their mothers the tired dog that will now have a long rest and the kind old shepherd with the helpless lamb under his arm through both these pictures mauve has expressed the same sympathy with and love for nature and its many changes of season and weather it is difficult indeed to choose one for study in preference to the other and it is perhaps for that reason that they are usually studied together in our picture of the sheep in spring with all its suggestions of growth and beauty the grass and leaves are luxuriant and yet the days and nights are still too cool for the sheep to be sheared when the warm days come the shepherd will probably drive his flock to the river or some clear stream where in spite of strugglings to escape their long woolly coats will be scrubbed and cleaned then when the wool is thoroughly dried it will be cut off with large shears and sent to the manufactories where it will be made into cloth for the garments we wear long ago in our great grandmothers day wool was carded spun and woven into cloth by hand many families still keep the old spinning wheels and hand looms which were used in those times questions to help the pupil understand the picture in what country was this picture painted what time of year is represented why does the shepherd keep the sheep back how can he prevent them from going too fast how do the sheep prefer to eat the grass what can you see at the right of the picture what is on each side of this road to what does it lead of what use are the sheep in what ways can the dog help the shepherd how does he keep the sheep together tell about the dog and the seven hundred lambs how can a trained dog understand his master even at a distance in what ways are sheep helpless how can a dog protect them from wolves what is the companion picture to this one called how does it differ from this painting which one do you like best why where are the original paintings the story of the artist anton mauve was born near the sea in a little village called zaandam the netherlands his father was a protestant clergyman in this thriving little town known for its oil and paper mills and its extensive timber trade when anton was but a boy the family moved to haarlem where he grew to manhood his talent for drawing was soon discovered but it did not meet with any favor at home his fathers strong objections to his becoming an artist were finally overcome by a compromise if anton would promise to win a diploma as a drawing master so that he would be sure of earning his living in case he failed as an artist then his father would give his consent as definite rules were laid down for teaching drawing and these rules permitted little or no originality anton mauve found his promise very hard to keep however he persevered when the course was finished he packed his grip and with little in his purse started for the village of oosterbeek where a number of other artists lived and worked later he settled in amsterdam where he worked hard earning enough with his painting to support himself mauve painted a great number of pictures many of them in water color he is best known by his flocks of sheep which he represents in all seasons and in every kind of weather although he lived by the sea very few of mauves pictures were of the sea for he preferred the country roads leading through green fields with here and there a flock of sheep or herd of cattle he seldom painted a landscape without some figure in it—a woodcart a man on horseback a peasant woman or a woodcutter were his most frequent models the birch tree with its graceful silvery stem was his favorite tree it is said that mauve was in the habit of making his sketches on his cuffs and by keeping the colors in his mind he was able from these suggestions to paint the pictures which soon brought him fame and honor questions about the artist who painted this picture where was he born what compromise did he make with his father why did he find it difficult to do his part what did he do then what subjects might we have expected him to choose for his paintings what subjects did he choose upon what did he often make his first sketches how did he finish these pictures what were his favorite models what was his favorite tree the suggestions to teachers studying the picture several days before the lesson is to be taken up the picture to be studied should be placed where every pupil can see it first of all the children should find out for themselves what is in the picture the questions accompanying the story of each picture are intended to help them to do this language work the pupils should be encouraged in class to talk freely and naturally in this way the lesson becomes a language exercise in which the pupils will gain in freedom of expression and in the ability to form clear mental images if a lesson does not occupy the entire drawing period the children should be asked to retell the story of the picture dramatization and drawing most of the stories told by the pictures lend themselves readily to dramatization and whenever practicable such stories should be acted out the stories also offer numerous interesting situations that may be used as subjects for drawing lessons the review lesson the review lesson should cover all pictures and artists studied throughout the year at this time other pictures available by the same artists should be on exhibition the review work may be conducted as a contest in which the pictures are held up one at a time while the class writes the name of the picture and the artist on slips of paper which have been prepared and numbered for that purpose one teacher who used this device surprised her class by presenting those whose lists were correct with their choice of any of the largesized perry pictures studied many teachers however will prefer to use this time for composition work although the description of pictures is often given as an english lesson pupils may write a description of their favorite picture in fact the lessons can be made to correlate with history geography english spelling reading or nature study in any event the real purpose of the work is that the pupils shall become so familiar with the pictures that they will recognize them as old friends whenever and wherever they may see them it is hoped that acquaintance with the picture and the interest awakened by its story will grow into a fuller appreciation and understanding of the artists work thus the children will have many happy hours and will learn to love the good the true and the beautiful in everything about them\n",

            "﻿ tommy scuffed his bare brown feet in the grass and didnt even notice how cooling and refreshing to his bare toes the green blades were usually he just loved to feel them but this afternoon he just didnt want to find anything pleasant or nice in the things he was accustomed to a scowl a deep dark heavy scowl had chased all merriment from his round freckled face it seemed as if the very freckles were trying to hide from it tommy didnt care he said so he said so right out loud he didnt care if all the world knew it he wanted the world to know it it was a horrid old world anyway this world which made a fellow go hunt up and drive home a lot of pesky cows just when all the other fellows were over at the swimminghole it always was that way whenever there was anything interesting or particular to do or any fun going on yes it was a horrid old world this world in which tommy lived and he was quite willing that everybody should know it the truth was tommy was deep very deep in the sulks he was so deep in them that he couldnt see jolly round mr sun smiling down on him he couldnt see anything lovely in the beautiful broad green meadows with the shadows of the clouds chasing  another across them he couldnt hear the music of the birds and the bees he couldnt even hear the merry little breezes whispering secrets as they danced around him he couldnt see and hear becausewell because he wouldnt see and hear that is always the way with people who go way down deep in the sulks presently he came to a great big st tommy stopped and scowled at it just as he had been scowling at everybody and everything he scowled at it as if he thought it had no business to be there yet all the time he was glad that it was there it was just the right size to sit on and try to make himself happy by being perfectly miserable you know some people actually find pleasure in thinking how miserable they are the more miserable they can make themselves feel the sor they begin to pity themselves and when they begin to pity themselves they seem to find what uncle jason calls a melancholy pleasure it was that way with tommy because no  else seemed to pity him he wanted to pity himself and to do that right he must first make himself feel the most miserable he possibly could so he sat down on the big st waved his stick for a few moments and then threw it away put his chin in his  hands and his  elbows on his  knees and began by scowling down at his bare brown toes theres never anything to do around here and when there is a fellow cant do it he grumbled other fellows dont have to weed the garden and bring in wood and drive the cows and when they do it it isnt just when they want to have some fun whats vacation for if it isnt to have a good time in and hows a fellow going to do it when he has to work all the timeanyway when he has to work just when he doesnt want to he was trying to be truthful fellows who live in town have something going on all the time while out here theres nothing but fields and woods and sky andand cows that havent sense enough to come home themselves when its time theres never anything exciting or intresting round here i wish he suddenly became aware of  very small bright eyes watching him from a little opening in the grass he scowled at them harder than ever and moved ever so little the eyes disappeared but a minute later they were back again full of curiosity a little doubtful a little fearful but tremendously interested they were the eyes of danny meadow mouse tommy knew them right away of course he did hadnt he chased danny with sticks and sts time and again but he didnt think of this now he was too full of his own troubles to remember that others had troubles too somehow dannys twinkling little eyes seemed to mock him how unjust things were you dont have to work he exploded so suddenly and fiercely that danny gave a frightened squeak and took to his heels you dont have anything to do but play all day and have a good time i wish i was a meadowmouse right then and there something happened tommy didnt know how it happened but it just did instead of a barelegged frecklefaced sulky boy sitting on the big st he suddenly found himself a little chunky bluntheaded furry animal with  short legs and a ridiculously short stubby tail and he was scampering after danny meadow mouse along a private little path through the meadowgrass he was a meadowmouse himself his wish had come true tommy felt very happy he had forgotten that he ever was a boy he raced along the private little path just as if he had always been accustomed to just such private little paths it might be very hot out in the sun but down there among the sheltering grass stems it was delightfully cool and comfortable he tried to shout for very joy but what he really did do was to squeak it was a thin sharp little squeak it was answered right away from in front of him and tommy didnt like the sound of it being a meadowmouse now he understood the speech of meadowmice and he knew that danny meadow mouse was demanding to know who was running in his private little path tommy suspected by the angry sound of dannys voice that he meant to fight tommy hesitated then he stopped he didnt want to fight you see he knew that he had no business in that path without an invitation from the owner if it had been his own path he would have been eager to fight but it wasnt and so he thought it best to avoid trouble he turned and scampered back a little way to a tiny branch path he followed this until it also branched and then took the new path but n of these paths really belonged to him he wanted some of his very own now the only way to have a private path of your very own in the green meadows is to make it unless you are big enough and strong enough to take  away from some  else so tommy set to work to make a path of his own and he did it by cutting the grass  stem at a time the very tender s he ate the dry s he carried to an old board he had discovered and under this he made a nest using the finest softest grasses for the inside of course it was work as a matter of fact had he as a boy had to work tenth as much or as hard as he now had to work as a meadowmouse he would have felt sure that he was the most abused boy who ever lived but being a meadowmouse he didnt think anything about it and scurried back and forth as fast as ever he could just stopping now and then to rest he knew that he must work for everything he hadthat without work he would have nothing and somehow this all seemed perfectly right he was busy and in keeping busy he kept happy presently as he sat down to rest a minute a merry little breeze came hurrying along and brought with it just the faintest kind of a sound it made his heart jump every little unexpected sound made his heart jump he listened with all his might there it was again something was stealing very very softly through the grass he felt sure it was danger of some kind then he did a foolish thinghe ran you see he was so frightened that he felt that he just couldnt sit still a second longer so he ran the instant he moved something big and terrible sprang at him and  great paws with sharp claws spread out all but landed on him he gave a frightened squeak and darted under a fallen old fencepost that lay half hidden in the tall grass whats the matter with you demanded a voice tommy found that he had company it was another meadowmouse iive had such a narrow escape panted tommy a terrible creature with awful claws almost caught me the stranger peeped out to see pooh said he that was only a cat cats dont know much if you keep your ears and eyes open its easy enough to fool cats but they are a terrible nuisance just the same because they are always prowling around when you least expect them i hate cats it is bad enough to have to watch out all the time for enemies who live on the green meadows without having to be always looking to see if a cat is about a cat hasnt any excuse at all it has all it wants to eat without trying to catch us it hunts just out of love of cruelty now reddy fox has some excuse he has to eat too bad hes so fond of meadowmice speaking of reddy have you seen him lately tommy shook his head i guess its safe enough to go out now continued the stranger i know where there is a lot of dandy corn lets go get some tommy was quite willing the stranger led the way first he looked this way and that way and listened for any sound of danger tommy did likewise but the way seemed clear and away they scampered right away tommy was happy again he had forgotten his recent fright that is the way with little people of the green meadows but he didnt forget to keep his ears and his eyes wide open for new dangers they reached the corn safely and then such a feast as they did have it seemed to tommy that never had he tasted anything half so good right in the midst of the feast the stranger gave a faint little squeak and darted under a pile of old cornstalks tommy didnt stop to ask questions but followed right at his heels a big black shadow swept over them and then passed on tommy peeped out there was a great bird with huge broad wings sailing back and forth over the meadows its old whitetail the marsh hawk he didnt get us that time chuckled the stranger and crept back to the delicious corn in  minutes they were having as good a time as before just as if they hadnt had a narrow escape when they had eaten all they could hold the stranger went back to his old fencepost and tommy returned to his own private paths and the snug nest he had built under the old board he was sleepy and he curled up for a good long nap when he awoke the first stars were beginning to twinkle down at him from the sky and black shadows lay over the green meadows he found that he could see quite as well as in the light of day and because he was already hungry again he started out to look for something to eat something inside warned him that he must watch out for danger now just as sharply as before though the black shadows seemed to promise safety just what he was to watch out for he didnt know still every few steps he stopped to look and listen he found that this was visiting time among the meadowmice and he made a great many friends there was a great deal of scurrying back and forth along private little paths and a great deal of squeaking at least that is what tommy would have called it had he still been a boy but as it was he understood it perfectly for it was meadowmouse language suddenly not a sound was to be heard not a single squeak or the sound of scurrying feet tommy sat perfectly still and held his breath he didnt know why but something inside told him to and he did then something passed over him it was like a black shadow and it was just as silent as a black shadow but tommy knew that it wasnt a black shadow for out of it  great round fierce yellow eyes glared down and struck such terror to his heart that it almost stopped beating but they didnt see him and he gave a tiny sigh of relief as he watched the grim living shadow sail on while he watched there was a frightened little squeak  legs with great curved claws dropped down from the shadow plunged into the grass and when they came up again they held a little limp form a little mouse had moved when he shouldnt have and hooty the owl had caught a dinner a dozen times that night tommy sat quite frozen with fear while hooty passed but after each time he joined with his fellows in merrymaking just as if there was no such thing as this terrible feathered hunter with the silent wings only each  was ready to hide at the first sign of danger when he grew tired of playing and eating he returned to his snug nest under the old board to sleep he was still asleep there the next morning when without any warning the old board was lifted in great fright tommy ran out of his nest and at once there was a great shout from a huge giant who struck at him with a stick and then chased him throwing sticks and sts n of which hit him but which frightened him terribly he dodged down a little path and ran for his life while behind him he heard the giant it was just a boy shouting and laughing as he poked about in the grass trying to find poor tommy and tommy wondered what he could be laughing about and what fun there could be in frightening a poor little meadowmouse almost to death later that very same morning while he was hard at work cutting a new path he heard footsteps behind him and turned to see a big black bird stalking along the little path he didnt wait for closer acquaintance but dived into the thick grass and as he did so the big black bird made a lunge at him but missed him it was his first meeting with blacky the crow and he had learned of  more enemy to watch out for illustration blacky the crow but most of all he feared reddy fox he never could be quite sure when reddy was about sometimes it would be in broad daylight and sometimes in the stilly night the worst of it was reddy seemed to know all about the ways of meadowmice and would lie perfectly still beside a little path until an unsuspecting mouse came along then there would be a sudden spring a little squeak cut short right in the middle and there would be  less happy little worker and playmate so tommy learned to look and listen before he started for any place and then to scurry as fast as ever he could twice mr gopher snake almost caught him and once he got away from billy mink by squeezing into a hole between some roots too small for billy to get in it was a very exciting life very exciting indeed he couldnt understand why when all he wanted was to be allowed to mind his own business and work and play in peace he must be forever running or hiding for his life he loved the sweet meadowgrasses and the warm sunshine he loved to hear the bees humming and the birds singing he thought the green meadows the most beautiful place in all the great world and he was very happy when he wasnt frightened but there was hardly an hour of the day or night that he didnt have at least  terrible fright still it was good to be alive and explore new places there was a big rock in front of him right now he wondered if there was anything to eat on top of it sometimes he found the very nicest seeds in the cracks of big rocks this  looked as if it would not be very hard to scramble up on he felt almost sure that he would find some treasure up there he looked this way and that way to make sure no  was watching then he scrambled up on the big rock for a few minutes tommy stared out over the green meadows they were very beautiful it seemed to him that they never had been so beautiful or the songs of the birds so sweet or the merry little breezes the children of old mother west wind so soft and caressing he couldnt understand it all for he wasnt a meadowmousejust a barefooted boy sitting on a big st that was just made to sit on as he looked down he became aware of  very small bright eyes watching him from a little opening in the grass he knew them right away of course he did they were the eyes of danny meadow mouse they were filled with curiosity a little doubtful a little fearful but tremendously interested tommy smiled and felt in his pocket for some crackercrumbs danny ran away at the first move but tommy scattered the crumbs where he could find them as he was sure to come back tommy stood up and stretched then he turned and looked curiously at the st on which he had been sitting i believe its a real wishingst said he then he laughed aloud im glad im not a meadowmouse but just a boy he cried i guess those cows are wondering what has become of me he started toward the pasture and now there was no frown darkening his freckled face it was clear and good to see and he whistled as he trampled along once he stopped and grinned sheepishly as his blue eyes drank in the beauty of the green meadows and beyond them the green forest and i said there was nothing interesting or exciting going on here why its the most exciting place i ever heard of only i didnt know it before he muttered gee i am glad im not a meadowmouse and if ever i throw sticks or sts at  again iwell i hope i turn into  and though danny meadow mouse timidly nibbling at the crackercrumbs didnt know it he had  less enemy to be afraid of   how tommy learned to admire thunderer the ruffed grouse from over in the green forest where the silver beeches grow came a sound which made tommy stop to listen for a minute or  all was still then it came again a deep throbbing sound that began slowly and then grew faster and faster until it ended in a long rumble like distant thunder tommy knew it couldnt be that for there wasnt a cloud in the sky and anyway it wasnt the season of thunderstorms again he heard that deep hollow throbbing grow fast and faster until there was no time between the beats and it became a thunderous rumble and for some reason which he could not have explained tommy felt his pulse beat faster in unison and a strange sense of joyous exhilaration drumdrumdrumdrumdrum drum drum drrrrrrum the sound beat out from beyond the hemlocks and rolled away through the woods its an old cockpartridge drumming tommy had a way of talking to himself when he was al hes down on that old beech log at the head of the gully gee id like to see him bet its the same  that was there last year dad says that old log is a reglar drumminglog and hes seen partridges drum there lots of times and yet he doesnt really know how they make all that noise says some folks say they beat the log with their wings and because its hollow it makes that sound dont believe it though theyd break their wings doing that besides that old log isnt much hollow anyway and i never can make it sound up much hammering it with a stick so how could a partridge do it with nothing but his wings some other folks say they do it by hitting their wings together over their backs but i dont see any sense in that because their wings are mostly feathers and some say they beat their sides to make the noise but if they do that i should think theyd knock all the wind out of themselves and be too sore to move bet if i could ever catch ol thunderer drumming id find out how he does it i know what ill do ill go over to the old wishingst wonder why i didnt think of it before then ill find out a lot he thrust his hands into his pockets and trudged up the crooked little path out of the green forest and over to the great gray st on the edge of the green meadows where once a wish had come true or had seemed to come true anyway and where he had learned so much about the life of danny meadow mouse as he tramped his thoughts were all of thunderer the ruffed grouse whom he called a partridge and some other people call a pheasant but who is neither many times had tommy been startled by having the handsome bird spring into the air from almost under his feet with a noise of wings that was enough to scare anybody it was because of this and the noise of his drumming that tommy called him thunderer with a long sigh of satisfaction for he was tired tommy sat down on the wishingst planted his elbows on his knees dropped his chin in his hands looked over to the green forest through halfclosed eyes and wished i wish said he slowly and earnestly i could be a partridge he meant of course that he could be a grouse just as had happened before when he had expressed such a wish on the old wishingst the very instant the words were out of his mouth he ceased to be a boy he was a tiny little bird like nothing so much as a teeny weeny chicken a soft little ball of brown and yellow  of a dozen who all looked alike as they scurried after their little brown mother in answer to her anxious cluck behind them on the ground cunningly hidden back of a fallen tree was an empty nest with only some bits of shell as a reminder that just a few hours before it had contained twelve buff eggs now tommy and his brothers and sisters didnt give the old nest so much as a thought they had left it as soon as they were strong enough to run they were starting out for their first lesson in the school of the great world perhaps tommy thought his mother fussy and altogether a great deal too nervous but if he did he didnt say so there was  thing that seemed to have been born in him something that as a boy he had to learn and that was the habit of instant obedience it was instinct which so naturalists say is habit confirmed and handed down through many generations tommy didnt know why he obeyed he just did that was all it didnt occur to him that there was anything else to do the idea of disobeying never entered his funny pretty little head and it was just so with all the others mother grouse had only to speak and they did just exactly what she told them to this habit of obedience on their part took a great load from the mind of mother grouse they hadnt been in the great world long enough to know but she knew that there were dangers on every side and to watch out for and protect them from these she needed all her senses and she couldnt afford to dull any of them by useless worrying so it was a great relief to her to know that when she had bidden them hide and keep perfectly still until she called them they would do exactly as she said this made it possible for her to leave them long enough to lead an enemy astray and be sure that when she returned she would find them just where she had left them she had to do this twice on their very first journey into the great world tommy was hurrying along with the others as fast as his small legs could take him when his mother gave a sharp but low call to hide there was a dried leaf on the ground close to tommy instantly he crept under it and flattened his small self to the ground closed his eyes tight and listened with all his might he heard the whir of strong wings as mother grouse took flight if he had peeped out he would have seen that she flew only a very little way and that when she came to earth again there appeared to be something the matter with her so that she flopped along instead of running or flying but he didnt see this because he was under that dead leaf presently the ground vibrated under the steps of heavy feet that all but trod on the leaf under which tommy lay and frightened him terribly but he did not move and he made no sound again had he peeped out he would have seen mother grouse fluttering along the ground just ahead of an eager boy who thought to catch her and tried and tried until he had been led far from the place where her babies were then all was still so still that surely there could be no danger near surely it was safe to come out now but tommy didnt move nor did any of his brothers and sisters they had been told not to until they were called and it never once entered their little heads to disobey mother knew best at last there came a gentle cluck instantly tommy popped out from under his leaf to see his brothers and sisters popping out from the most unexpected places all about him it seemed almost as if they had popped out of the very ground itself and there was mother grouse very proud and very fussy as she made sure that all her babies were there later that same day the same thing happened only this time there was no heavy footstep but the lightest kind of patter as cushid feet eagerly hurried past and reddy fox sprang forward sure that mother grouse was to make him the dinner he liked best and thus was led away to a safe distance there to realize how completely he had been fooled it was a wonderful day that first day there was a great anthill which mother grouse scratched open with her stout claws exposing ever and ever so many white things which were the socalled eggs of the big black ants and which were delicious eating as tommy soon found out it was great fun to scramble for them and eat and eat until not another  could be swallowed and when the shadow began to creep through the green forest they nestled close under mother grouse in  of her favorite secret hidingplaces and straightway went to sleep as healthy children should sure that no harm could befall them nor once guessed how lightly their mother slept and more than once shivered with fear not for herself but for them as some prowler of the night passed their retreat so the days passed and tommy grew and learned and it was a question which he did the faster the down with which he had been covered gave way to real feathers and he grew real wings so that he was little over a week old when he could fly in case of need and in that same length of time short as it was he had filled his little head with knowledge he had learned that a big sandy dome in a sunny spot in the woods usually meant an ants castle where he could eat to his hearts content if only it was torn open for him he had learned that luscious fat worms and bugs were to be found under rotting pieces of bark and the litter of decaying old logs and stumps he had learned that wild strawberries and some other berries afforded a welcome variety to his bill of fare illustration bugs were to be found under old logs he had learned that a daily bath in fine dust was necessary for cleanliness as well as being vastly comforting he had learned that danger lurked in the air as well as on the ground for a swooping hawk had caught  of his brothers who had not instantly heeded his mothers warning but most important of all he had learned the value of that first lesson in obedience and to trust wholly to the wisdom of mother grouse and never to question her commands a big handsome grouse had joined them now it was old thunderer and sometimes when he would throw back his head spread his beautiful tail until it was like a fan raise the crest on his head and the glossy ruff on his neck and proudly strut ahead of them tommy thought him the most beautiful sight in all the world and wondered if ever he would grow to be half as handsome while he did little work in the care of the brood thunderer was of real help to mother grouse in guarding the little family from everlurking dangers there was no eye or ear more keen than his and n more skillful than he in confusing and baffling a hungry enemy who had chanced to discover the presence of the little family tommy watched him every minute he could spare from the ever important business of filling his crop and stored up for future need the things he learned once he ventured to ask thunderer what was the greatest danger for which a grouse must watch out and he never forgot the answer there is no greatest danger while you are young replied thunderer shaking out his feathers every danger is greatest while it exists never forget that never treat any danger lightly skunks and foxes and weasels and minks and coons and hawks and owls are equally dangerous to youngsters like you and  is as much to be feared as another it is only when you have become fullgrown like me and then only in the fall of the year that you will know the greatest danger and what is that asked tommy timidly a man with a gun replied thunderer and what is that asked tommy again eager for knowledge a great creature who walks on  legs and points a stick which spits fire and smoke and makes a great noise and kills while it is yet a long distance off oh gasped tommy how is  ever to learn to avoid such a dreadful danger as that ill teach you when the time comes replied thunderer now run along and take your dustbath you must first learn to avoid other dangers before you will be fitted to meet the greatest danger all that long bright summer tommy thought of that greatest danger and by learning how to meet other dangers tried to prepare himself for it sometimes he wondered if there really could be any greater danger than those about him every day it seemed sometimes as if all the world sought to kill him who was so harmless himself not only were there dangers from hungry animals and robbers of the air but also from the very creatures that furnished him much of his livingthe tribe of insects an uglylooking insect called a tick with wicked bloodsucking jaws killed  of the brood while they were yet small and an equally ugly worm called a borm caused the death of another shadow the weasel surprised  foolish bird who insisted on sleeping on the ground when he was big enough to know better and reddy fox dined on another whose curiosity led him to move when he had been warned to lie perfectly still and who paid for his disobedience with his life tommy not  feet away saw it all and profited by the lesson he was big enough now to act for himself and no longer depended wholly for safety on the wisdom of mother grouse and thunderer but while he trusted to his own senses and judgment he was ever heedful of their example and still ready to learn especially did he take pains to keep near thunderer and study him and his ways for he was wise and cunning with the cunning of experience and knowledge tommy was filled with great admiration for him and tried to copy him in everything thus it was that he learned that there were  ways of flying  without noise and the other with the thunder of whirring wings also he learned that there was a time for each when he knew himself to be al and suddenly detected the approach of an enemy he often would launch himself into the air on silent wings before his presence had been discovered but when others of his family were near he would burst into the air with all the noise he could make as a warning to others also it sometimes startled and confused the enemy thunderer had taught him the trick  day when reddy fox had stolen unseen by tommy almost within jumping distance thunderer had seen him and purposely had waited until reddy was just gathering himself to spring on the unsuspecting tommy then with a splendid roar of his stout wings thunderer had risen just to  side of the fox so startling him and distracting his attention that tommy had had ample time to whir up in his turn to the discomfiture of reddy fox so when the fall came tommy was big from good living and filled with the knowledge that makes for long life among grouse he knew the best scratchinggrounds the choicest feedingplaces according to the month every brambletangle and every brushpile the place for the warmest sunbath and the trees which afforded the safest and most comfortable roosting places at night he knew the ways and the favorite huntinggrounds of every fox and weasel and skunk and coon of the neighborhood and how to avoid them he knew when it was safest to lie low and trust to the protective coloring of his feathers and when it was best to roar away on thundering wings the days grew crisp and shorter the maples turned red and yellow and soon the woods were filled with fluttering leaves and the trees began to grow bare it was then that old thunderer warned tommy that the season of greatest danger was at hand somehow in the confidence of his strength and the joy of the splendid tide of life surging through him he didnt fear this unknown danger as he had when as a little fellow he had first heard of it then  day quite unexpectedly he faced it he and thunderer had been resting quietly in a brambletangle on the very edge of the green forest when suddenly there was the rustle of padded feet in the leaves just outside the brambles looking out tommy saw what at first he took to be a strange and very large kind of fox and he prepared to fly not yet not yet warned thunderer that is a dog and he will not harm us but to fly now might be to go straight into that greatest danger of which i had told you that is the mistake young grouse often make flying before they know just where the danger is watch until you see the legged creature with the firestick then follow me and do just as i do the dog was very near now in fact he had his nose in the brambles and was standing as still as if turned to st  of his fore feet lifted and pointing straight at them no  moved presently tommy heard heavy steps and looking through the brambles saw the great legged creature of whom thunderer had told him now cried thunderer do as i do with a great roar of wings he burst out of the tangle on the opposite side from where the hunter was and flying low so as to keep the brambles between himself and the hunter swerved sharply to the left to put a tree between them and then flew like a bullet straight into the green forest where the trees were thickest skillfully dodging the great trunks and at last at a safe distance sailing up over the tops to take to the ground on the other side of a hill and there run swiftly for a way tommy followed closely doing exactly as thunderer did even as he swerved behind the first tree he heard a terrible double roar behind him and the sharp whistle of things which cut through the leaves around him and struck the tree behind him  even nipped a brown feather from his back he was terribly frightened but he was unhurt as he joined thunderer behind the hill now you know what the greatest danger is said thunderer never fly until you know just where the hunter is and then fly back of a bush or a tree the bigger the better or drop over the edge of a bank if there is  make as much noise as you can when you get up it may startle the hunter so that he cannot point his firestick straight if he has no dog it is sometimes best to lie still until he has passed and then fly silently if there is no tree or other cover near enough when you first see the dog run swiftly until you reach a place where it will be safe to take wing for the next few weeks it seemed as if from daylight to dark the woods were filled with dogs and hunters and tommy knew no hour of peace and security until the coming of night many a dreadful tragedy did tommy see when companions less cunning than old thunderer were stricken in midair and fell lifeless to the ground but he learning quickly and doing as thunderer did escaped unharmed at last the law of which tommy knew nothing put an end to the murder of the innocents and for another year the greatest danger was over but now came a new danger it was the month of madness tommy and all his companions were seized with an irresistible desire to fly aimlessly blindly sometimes in the darkness of night they knew not where and in this mad flight some met death breaking their necks against buildings and against telegraph wires where he went or what he did during this period of madness tommy never knew but when it left him as abruptly as it had come he found himself in the street of a village with swift strong wings he shot into the air and headed straight back for the dear green forest now no longer green save where the hemlocks and pines grew once back there he took up the old life and was happy for he felt himself a match for any foe the days grew shorter and the cold increased there were still seeds and acorns and some berries but with the coming of the snow these became more and more scarce and tommy was obliged to resort to catkins and buds on the trees between his toes there grew little horny projections which were his snowshoes and enabled him to get about on the snow without sinking in he learned to dive into the deep soft snow for warmth and safety once he was nearly trapped there a hard crust formed in the night and when morning came tommy had hard work to break out so the long winter wore away and spring came with all its gladness tommy was fully as big as old thunderer now and just as handsome and he began to take pride in his appearance and to strut  day he came to an old log and jumping up on it strutted back and forth proudly with his fanlike tail spread its fullest and his broad ruff raised then he heard the long rolling thunder of another grouse drumming instantly he began to beat his wings against the air not as in flying but with a more downward motion and to his great delight there rolled from under them that same thunder slowly he beat at first and then faster and faster until he was forced to stop for breath he was drumming then he listened for a reply drumdrumdrumdrumdrum drum drum drrrrrrrum tommys eyes flew open he was sitting on the old wishingst on the edge of the green meadows for a minute he blinked in confusion then from over in the green forest came that sound like distant thunder drumdrumdrumdrumdrum drum drum drrrrrrrum its ol thunderer again on that beech log cried tommy and now i know how he does it he just beats the air i know because ive d it myself geewhilikens im glad im not really a partridge bet ill never hunt  after this or let anybody else if i can help it isnt this old wishingst the dandy place to learn things though i guess the only way of really knowing how birds and animals live and feel is by being  of em somehow it makes things look all different just listen to ol thunderer drum i know now just how fine he feels im going to get father to put up a sign and stop all shooting in our part of the green forest next fall and then there wont be any greatest danger there and tommy whistling merrily started for home   what happened when tommy became a mink it was not often that tommy caught so much as a glimpse of billy mink and every time he did he had the feeling that he had been smart very smart indeed the funny thing is that this feeling annoyed tommy yes it did it annoyed him because it seemed so very foolish to think that there was anything smart in just seeing billy mink and yet every time he did see him he had the feeling that he had really d something out of the usual little by little he realized that it was because billy mink himself is so smart and manages to keep out of sight so much of the time that just seeing him once in a while gave him the feeling of being smarter than billy at the same time he was never quite sure that billy didnt intend to be seen somehow that little browncoated scamp always seemed to be playing with him he would appear so suddenly that tommy never could tell just where he came from and he would disappear quite as quickly tommy never could tell where he went he just vanished that was all it was this that made tommy feel that he had been smart to see him at all now tommy had been acquainted with billy mink for a long time that is to say he had known billy by sight more than that he had tried to trap billy and in trying to trap him he had learned some of billys ways in fact tommy had spent a great deal of time trying to catch billy you see he wanted that little brown fur coat of billys because he could sell it but it was very clear that billy wanted that little fur coat himself to wear and also that he knew all about traps so billy still wore his coat and tommy had taken up his traps and put them away with a sigh for the my which he had hoped that that coat would bring him and with a determination that when cold weather should come again he would get it you see it was summer now and the little fur coat was of no value then save to billy himself in truth tommy would have forgotten all about it until autumn came again had not billy suddenly popped out in front of him that very morning while tommy was trying to catch a trout in a certain quiet pool in the laughing brook deep in the green forest tommy had been sitting perfectly still like the good fisherman that he was not making the tiniest sound when he just seemed to feel  eyes fixed on him very very slowly tommy turned his head he did it so slowly that it almost seemed as if he didnt move it at all but careful as he was he had no more than a bare glimpse of a little brown animal who disappeared as by magic its that mink thought tommy and continued to stare at the spot where he had last seen billy the rustle of a leaf almost behind him caused him to forget and to turn quickly again he had just a glimpse of something brown then it was g where he hadnt the least idea it was g that was all tommy forgot all about trout it was more fun to try to get a good look at billy mink and to see what he was doing and where he was going tommy remembered all that he had been taught or had read about how to act when trying to watch his little wild neighbors and he did the best he could but all he got was a fleeting glimpse now and then which was most tantalizing at last he gave up and reeled in his fishline then he started for home all the way he kept thinking of billy mink he couldnt get billy out of his head little by little he realized how when all was said and d he didnt know anything about billy that is he didnt really knowhe just guessed at things and here he is  of my neighbors thought tommy i know a great deal about peter rabbit and chatterer the red squirrel and reddy fox and a lot of others but i dont know anything about billy mink and hes too smart to let me find out huh he neednt be so secret about everything im not going to hurt him then into tommys head crept a guilty remembrance of those traps a little flush crept into tommys face anyway im not going to hurt him now he added by this time he had reached the great gray st on the edge of the green meadows the wishingst just as a matter of course he sat down on the edge of it he never could get by without sitting down on it it was a very beautiful scene that stretched out before tommy but though he seemed to be gazing out at it he didnt see it at all he was looking through unseeing eyes the fact is he was too busy thinking and his thoughts were all of billy mink it must be great fun to be able to go and come any hour of the day or night and to be so nimble and smart i wish i were a mink said tommy slowly and very earnestly of course you know what happened then the same thing happened that had happened before on the old wishingst tommy was the very thing he had wished to be he was a mink yes sir tommy was a tiny furry little fellow with brothers and sisters and the nicest little home in a hollow log hidden among bulrushes close by the laughing brook and with a big pile of brush near it indeed  end of the old log was under the brushpile that made the very safest kind of a playground for the little minks it was there that mother mink gave them their first lessons in a game called nowyouseemenowyoudont they thought they were just playing but all the time they were learning something that would be most important and useful to them when they were older tommy was very quick to learn and just as quick in his movements so that it wasnt long before he could outrun outdodge and outhide any of his companions and mother mink began to pay special attention to his education she was proud of him and because she was proud of him she intended to teach him all the mink lore which she knew so tommy was the first of the family to be taken fishing ever since he and his brothers and sisters had been big enough to eat solid food they had had fish as a part of their bill of fare and there was nothing that tommy liked better where they came from he had never bothered to ask all he cared about was the eating of them but now he was actually going to catch some and he felt very important as he glided along behind his mother presently they came to a dark deep pool in the laughing brook mrs mink peered into its depths there was the glint of something silvery down there in the brown water in a flash mrs mink had disappeared in the pool entering the water so smoothly as to hardly make a splash for a moment tommy saw her dark form moving swiftly then he lost it his little eyes blazed with eagerness and excitement as he watched ha what was that there was something moving under water on the other side of the pool then out popped the brown head of mrs mink and in her teeth was a fat trout tommys mouth watered at the sight what a feast he would have illustration out popped the brown head of mrs mink and in her teeth was a fat trout but instead of bringing the fish to him mrs mink climbed out on the opposite bank and disappeared in the brush there tommy swallowed hard with disappointment could it be that he wasnt to have any of it after all in a few minutes mrs mink was back again but there was no sign of the fish then tommy knew that she had hidden it and for just a minute a wicked thought popped into his head he would swim across and hunt for it but mother mink didnt give him a chance though tommy didnt see it there was a twinkle in her eyes as she said now you have seen how easy it is to catch a fish i shall expect you to catch all you eat hereafter come along with me to the next pool and show me how well you have learned your lesson she led the way down the laughing brook and presently they came to another little brown pool eagerly tommy peered into it at first he saw nothing then almost under him he discovered a fat trout lazily watching for a good meal to come along with a great splash tommy dived into the pool for just a second he closed his eyes as he struck the water when he opened them the trout was nowhere to be seen tommy looked very crestfallen and foolish as he crawled up on the bank where mother mink was laughing at him how do you expect to catch fish when you splash like that she asked tommy didnt know so he said nothing now you come with me and practise on little fish first she continued and led him to a shallow pool in which a school of minnows were at play now tommy was particularly fond of trout as all mink are and he was inclined to turn up his nose at minnows but he wisely held his tongue and prepared to show that he had learned his lesson this time he slipped into the water quietly and then made a swift dash at the nearest minnow he missed it quite as mother mink had expected he would but now his dander was up he would catch  of those minnows if it took him all the rest of the day  times he tried and missed but the th time his sharp little teeth closed on a finny victim and he proudly swam ashore with the fish things you catch yourself always taste best said mother mink now well go over on the meadows and catch some mice tommy scowled i want to catch some more fish said he not the least bit of use for you to try retorted mother mink dont you see that you have frightened those minnows so that they have left the pool besides it is time that you learned to hunt as well as fish and youll find it is just as much fun tommy doubted it but he obediently trotted along at the heels of mother mink out onto the green meadows presently they came to a tiny little path through the meadow grasses mother mink sniffed in it and tommy did the same there was the odor of meadowmouse and once more tommys mouth watered he quite forgot about the fish mother mink darted ahead and presently tommy heard a faint squeak he hurried forward to find mother mink with a fat meadowmouse tommy smacked his lips but she took no notice instead she calmly ate the meadowmouse herself tommy didnt need to be told that if he wanted meadowmouse he would have to catch  for himself with a little angry toss of his head he trotted off along the little path presently he came to another his nose told him a meadowmouse had been along that way recently with his nose to the ground he began to run other little paths branched off from the  he was in tommy paid no attention to them until suddenly he realized that he no longer smelled meadowmouse he kept on a little farther hoping that he would find that entrancing smell again but he didnt so he stopped to consider then he turned and ran back keeping his nose to the ground so he came to  of those little branch paths and there he caught the smell of meadowmouse again he turned into the little branch path and the smell grew stronger he ran faster then his quick ears caught the sound of scurrying feet ahead of him he darted along and there running for his life was a fat meadowmouse half a dozen bounds brought tommy up with him whereupon the mouse turned to fight now the mouse was big and a veteran and tommy was only a youngster it was his first fight for just a second he paused at the sight of the sharp little teeth confronting him then he sprang into his first fight the fierce lust of battle filled him his eyes blazed red there was a short sharp struggle and then the mouse went limp and lifeless very proudly tommy dragged it out to where mother mink was waiting she would have picked it up and carried it easily but tommy wasnt big enough for that after that tommy went hunting or fishing every day sometimes the whole family went and such fun as they would have  day they would hunt frogs around the edge of the smiling pool again they would visit a swamp and dig out worms and insects but best of all they liked to hunt the meadowmice so the long summer wore away and the family kept together but as the cool weather of the fall came tommy grew more and more restless he wanted to see the great world sometimes he would go off and be g  or  days at a time then  day he bade the old home goodby forever though he didnt know it at the time he simply started off following the laughing brook to the great river in search of adventure and in the joy of exploring new fields he forgot all about home he was a fine big fellow by this time and very smart in the ways of the mink world life was just a grand holiday he hunted or fished when he was hungry and when he was tired he curled up in the nearest hidingplace and slept sometimes it was in a hollow log or stump again it was in an old rockpile or under a heap of brush when he had slept enough he was off again on his travels and it made no difference to him whether it was night or day he just ate when he pleased slept when he pleased and wandered on where and when he pleased he was afraid of no  once in a while a fox would try to catch him or a fierce hawk would swoop at him but tommy would dodge like a flash and laugh as he ducked into some hole or other hidingplace he had learned that quickness of movement often is more than a match for mere size and strength so he was not afraid of any of his neighbors for those he was not strong enough to fight he was clever enough to elude he could run swiftly climb like a squirrel and swim like a fish because he was so slim he could slip into all kinds of interesting holes and dark corners and explore st and brush piles in fact he could go almost anywhere he pleased his nose was as keen as that of a dog he was always testing the air or sniffing at the ground for the odor of other little people who had passed that way when he was hungry and ran across the trail of some  he fancied he would follow it just as bowser the hound follows the trail of reddy fox sometimes he would follow the trail of reddy himself just to see what he was doing for the most part he kept near water he dearly loved to explore a brook running along beside it swimming the pools investigating every hole in the banks and the piles of drift stuff when he was feeling lazy and there were no fish handy he would catch a frog or  or a couple of pollywogs or a crayfish occasionally he would leave the low land and the water for the high land and hunt rabbits and grouse sometimes he surprised other ground birds once he visited a farmyard and slipping into the henhouse at night killed  fat hens of course he could not eat the whole of even  tommy asked no favors of any  his was a happy carefree life to be sure he had few friends save among his own kind but he didnt mind this he rather enjoyed the fact that all who were smaller and some who were larger than he feared him he was lithe and strong and wonderfully quick fighting was a joy it was this as much as anything that led him into a fight with a big muskrat much bigger than himself the muskrat was stout and his great teeth looked dangerous but he was slow and clumsy in his movements compared with tommy and though he was full of courage and fought hard the battle was not long after that tommy hunted muskrats whenever the notion seized him winter came but tommy minded it not at all his thick fur coat kept him warm and the air was like tonic in his veins it was good to be alive he hunted rabbits in the snow he caught fish at springholes in the ice he traveled long distances under the ice running along the edge of the water where it had fallen away from the frozen crust swimming when he had to investigating muskrat holes and now and then surprising the tenant unlike his small cousin shadow the weasel he seldom hunted and killed just for the fun of killing sometimes when fishing was especially good and he caught more than he could use he would hide them away against a day of need in killing the mink is simply obeying the law of old mother nature for she has given him flesheating teeth and without meat he could not live in this respect he is no worse than man for man kills to live for the most of the time tommy was just a happygolucky traveler who delighted in exploring new places and who saw more of the great world than most of his neighbors the weather never bothered him he liked the sun but he would just as soon travel in the rain when a fierce snowstorm raged he traveled under the ice along the bed of the nearest brook or river it was just the life he had dreamed of as a boy he was an adventurer a freebooter and all the world was his he had no work he had no fear for as yet he had not encountered man hooty the owl by night and certain of the big hawks by day were all he had to watch out for and these he did not really fear for he felt himself too smart for them but at last he did learn fear it came to him when he discovered another mink fast in a trap he didnt understand those strange jaws which bit into the flesh and held and yet were not alive he hid nearby and watched and he saw a great legged creature come and take the mink away then cautiously tommy investigated he caught the odor of the man scent and a little chill of fear ran down his backb but in spite of all his care there came a fateful day he was running along a brook in shallow water when snap from the bottom of the brook itself the dreadful jaws sprang up and caught him by a leg there had been no smell of man to give him warning for the running water had carried it away tommy gave a little shriek as he felt the dreadful thing and thenhe was just tommy sitting on the wishingst he stared thoughtfully over at the green forest then he shuddered you see he remembered just how he had felt when that trap had snapped on his leg i dont want your fur coat billy mink said he just as if billy could hear him if it wasnt for traps you surely would enjoy life just the same i wouldnt trade places with you not even if i do have to hoe corn just when i want to go swimming and with this tommy started for home and the hoe and somehow the task didnt look so very dreadful after all   tommy becomes a very humble person hello old mr sobersides where are you bound for as he spoke tommy thrust a foot in front of old mr toad and laughed as mr toad hopped up on it and then off quite as if he were accustomed to having big feet thrust in his way not that tommy had especially big feet they simply were big in comparison with mr toad never saw you in a hurry before continued tommy whats it all about you are going as if you were bound for somewhere in particular and as if you had something special on your mind what is it anyway now of course old mr toad didnt make any reply at least he didnt make any that tommy heard if he had tommy wouldnt have understood it the fact is it did look for all the world as if it was just as tommy had said if ever any  had an important engagement to keep and meant to keep it mr toad did if looks counted anything hoppityhophophop hoppityhophophop he went straight down toward the green meadows and he didnt pay any attention to anybody or anything tommy was interested he had known old mr toad ever since he could remember and he couldnt recall ever having seen him go anywhere in particular whenever tommy had noticed him he had seemed to be hopping about in the most aimless sort of way and never took more than a half dozen hops without sitting down to think it over so it was very surprising to see him traveling along in this determined fashion and having nothing better to do tommy decided to follow him and find out what he could so down the l little path traveled old mr toad hoppityhophophop hoppityhophophop and behind him strolled tommy and while old mr toad seemed to be going very fast and was for him tommy was having hard work to go slow enough to stay behind and this shows what a difference mere size may make when they reached the wishingst mr toad was tired from having hurried so and tommy was equally tired from the effort of going slow so both were glad to sit down for a rest old mr toad crept in under the edge of the wishingst on the shady side and tommy still thinking of old mr toad sat down on the wishingst itself i wonder he chuckled if he has come down here to wish perhaps hell wish himself into something beautiful as they do in fairy stories i should think hed want to goodness knows hes homely enough its bad enough to be freckled but to be covered with wartsugh there isnt a single beautiful thing about him as he said this tommy leaned over that he might better look at old mr toad and mr toad looked up at tommy quite as if he understood what tommy had said so that tommy looked straight into mr toads eyes it was the first time in all his life that tommy had ever looked into a toads eyes whoever would think of looking at the eyes of a hoptoad certainly not tommy eyes were eyes and a toad had  of them wasnt that enough to know why under the sun should a fellow bother about the color of them or anything like that what difference did it make well it made just the difference between knowing and not knowing between knowledge and ignorance between justice and injustice tommy suddenly realized this as he looked straight into the eyes of old mr toad and it gave him a funny feeling inside it was something like that feeling you have when you speak to some  you think is an old friend and find him to be a total stranger ii beg your pardon mr toad said he i take it all back you have something beautifulthe most beautiful eyes ive ever seen if i had eyes as beautiful as yours i wouldnt care how many freckles i had why havent i ever seen them before old mr toad slowly blinked as much as to say thats up to you young man theyre the same  eyes ive always had if you havent learned to use your own eyes that is no fault and no business of mine if i made as little use of my eyes as you do of yours i shouldnt last long it never before had occurred to tommy that there was anything particularly interesting about old mr toad but those beautiful eyesfor a toads eyes are truly beautiful so beautiful that they are the cause of the old legend that a toad carries jewels in his headset him to thinking the more he thought the more he realized how very little he knew about this homely common neighbor of the garden all i know about him is that he eats bugs muttered tommy and on that account is a pretty good fellow to have around my but he has got beautiful eyes i wonder if there is anything else interesting about him i wonder if i should wish to be a toad just to learn about him if i could be  i guess some of the wishes ive made on this old st have been sort of foolish because every time ive been discontented or envious and i guess the wishes have come true just to teach me a lesson im not discontented now i should say not a fellow would be pretty poor stuff to be discontented on a beautiful spring day like this and i dont envy old mr toad not a bit unless its for his beautiful eyes and i guess that doesnt count i dont see how he can have a very interesting life but i almost want to wish just to see if it will come true at that moment old mr toad came out from under the wishingst and started on down the l little path just as before he seemed to be in a hurry to get somewhere and to have something on his mind tommy had to smile as he watched his awkward hops i may as well let him get a good start because he goes so very slow thought tommy and dreamily watched until old mr toad was just going out of sight around a turn in the l little path then instead of getting up and following tommy suddenly made up his mind to test the old wishingst i wish said he right out aloud i wish i could be a toad no sor were the words out of his mouth than he was hurrying down the l little path after old mr toad hophophoppityhop a toad himself he knew now just where old mr toad was bound for and he was in a hurry a tremendous hurry to get there himself it was the smiling pool he didnt know why he wanted to get there but he did it seemed to him that he couldnt get there quick enough it was spring and the joy of spring made him tingle all over from the tip of his nose to the tips of his toes but with it was a great longinga longing for the smiling pool it was a longing very much like homesickness he felt that he couldnt be really happy until he got there and that nothing could or should keep him away from there he couldnt even stop to eat he knew too that that was just the way old mr toad was feeling and it didnt surprise him as he hurried along hophophoppityhop to find other toads all headed in the same direction and all in just as much of a hurry as he was suddenly he heard a sound that made him hurry faster than ever or at least try to it was a clear sweet peep peep peep its my cousin stickytoes the treetoad and hes got there before me thought tommy and tried to hop faster that single peep grew into a great chorus of peeps and now he heard other voices the voices of his other cousins the frogs he began to feel that he must sing too but he couldnt stop for that at last tommy reached the smiling pool and with a last long hop landed in the shallow water on the edge how good the cool water felt to his dry skin at the very first touch the great longing left tommy and a great content took its place he had reached home and he knew it it was the same way with old mr toad and with the other toads that kept coming and coming from all directions and the very first thing that many of them did as soon as they had rested a bit waswhat do you think why each  began to sing yes sir a great many of those toads began to sing if tommy had been his true self instead of a toad he probably would have been more surprised than he was when he discovered that old mr toad had beautiful eyes but he wasnt surprised now for the very good reason that he was singing himself tommy could no more help singing than he could help breathing just as he had to fill his lungs with air so he had to give expression to the joy that filled him he just had to and as the most natural expression of joy is in song tommy added his voice to the great chorus of the smiling pool in his throat was a pouch for which he had not been aware that he had any particular use now he found out what it was for he filled it with air and it swelled and swelled like a little balloon until it was actually larger than his head and though he wasnt aware of it he filled it in a very interesting way he drew the air in through his nostrils and then forced it through  little slits in the floor of his mouth all the time he kept his mouth tightly closed that little balloon was for the purpose of increasing the sound of his voice later he discovered that he could sing when wholly under water with mouth and nostrils tightly closed by passing the air back and forth between his lungs and that throatpouch it was the same way with all the other toads and on all sides tommy saw them sitting upright in the shallow water with their funny swelledout throats and singing with all their might in all the great world there was no more joyous place than the smiling pool in those beautiful spring days it seemed as if everybody sangredwing the blackbird in the bulrushes little friend the songsparrow in the bushes along the edge of the laughing brook bubbling bob the bobolink in the top of the nearest tree on the green meadows and the toads and frogs in every part of the smiling pool but of all those songs there was n sweeter or more expressive of perfect happiness than that of tommy and his neighbor homely almost uglylooking old mr toad illustration tommy saw them sitting upright in the shallow water but it was not quite true that everybody sang tommy found it out in a way that put an end to his own singing for a little while jolly round bright mr sun was shining his brightest and the singers of the smiling pool were doing their very best when suddenly old mr toad cut his song short right in the middle so did other toads and frogs on both sides of him tommy stopped too just because the others did there was something fearsome in that sudden ending of glad song tommy sat perfectly still with a queer feeling that something dreadful was happening he didnt move but he rolled his eyes this way and that way until he saw something moving on the edge of the shore it was mr blacksnake just starting to crawl away and from his mouth  long legs were feebly kicking  of the sweet singers would sing no more after that no matter how glad and happy he felt as he sang he kept a sharp watch all the time for mr snake for he had learned that there was danger even in the midst of joy but when the dusk of evening came he knew that mr snake was no longer to be feared and he sang in perfect peace and contentment until there came an evening when again that mighty chorus stopped abruptly a shadow passed over him looking up he saw a great bird with soundless wings and hanging from its claws  of the sweet singers whose voice was stilled forever hooty the owl had caught his supper so tommy learned that not all folk sing their joy in spring and that those who do not such as mr blacksnake and hooty the owl were to be watched out for too bad too bad whispered old mr toad as they waited for some  to start the chorus again that fellow was careless he didnt watch out he forgot bad business forgetting bad business doesnt do at all now ive lived a great many years and i expect to live a great many more i never forget to watch out we toads havent very many enemies and if we watch out for the few we have there isnt much to worry about its safe to start that chorus again so here goes he swelled his throat out and began to sing in five minutes it was as if nothing had happened at the smiling pool so the glad spring passed and tommy saw many things of interest he saw thousands of tiny eggs hatch into funny little tadpoles and for a while it was hard to tell at first glance the toad tadpoles from their cousins the frog tadpoles but the little toad babies grew fast and it was almost no time at all before they were not tadpoles at all but tiny little toads with tails day by day the tails grew shorter until there were no tails at all each baby a perfect little toad no bigger than a goodsized cricket but big enough to consider that he had outgrown his nursery and to be eager to leave the smiling pool and go out into the great world foolish foolish much better off here got a lot to learn before they can take care of themselves in the great world grumbled old mr toad then he chuckled know just how they feel though said he felt the same way myself at their age suppose you did too of course tommy never having been little like that for he had wished himself into a fullgrown toad had no such memory but old mr toad didnt seem to expect a reply for he went right on took care of myself and i guess those little rascals can do the same thing by the way this water is getting uncomfortably warm besides ive got business to attend to cant sing all the time holidays are over think ill start along back tonight are you going my way now tommy hadnt thought anything about the matter he had noticed that a great many toads were leaving the smiling pool and that he himself didnt care so much about singing then too he longed for a good meal for he had eaten little since coming to the smiling pool so when old mr toad asked if he was going his way tommy suddenly decided that he was good replied old mr toad well start as soon as it begins to grow dark its safer then besides i never could travel in bright hot weather its bad for the health so when the black shadows began to creep across the green meadows old mr toad and tommy turned their backs on the smiling pool and started up the l little path they were not in a hurry now as they had been when they came down the l little path and they hopped along slowly stopping to hunt bugs and slugs and worms for they were very very hungry old mr toad fixed his eyes on a fly which had just lighted on the ground  inches in front of him he sat perfectly still but there was a lightninglike flash of something pink from his mouth and the fly was g mr toad smacked his lips i dont see how some people get along with their tongues fastened way back in their throats he remarked the proper place for a tongue to be fastened is the way ours areby the front end then you can shoot it out its whole length and get your meal every time see that spider over there if i tried to get any nearer hed be g at the first move hes a gr anyway watch there was that little pink flash again and sure enough the spider had disappeared once more old mr toad smacked his lips didnt i tell you he was a gr said he chuckling over his own joke tommy quite agreed with old mr toad that arrangement of his tongue certainly was most convenient any insect he liked to eat that came within  inches of his nose was as good as caught all he had to do was to shoot out his tongue which was sticky and when he drew it back it brought the bug with it and carried it well down his throat to a comfortable point to swallow yes it certainly was convenient it took so much time to fill their stomachs that they did not travel far that night the next day they spent under an old barrel where they buried themselves in the soft earth by digging holes with their stout hind feet and backing in at the same time until just their noses and eyes showed at the doorways ready to snap up any foolish bugs or worms who might seek shelter in their hidingplace it was such a comfortable place that they stayed several days going out nights to hunt and returning at daylight it was while they were there that old mr toad complained that his skin was getting too tight and uncomfortable and announced that he was going to change it and he did it was a pretty tiresome process and required a lot of wriggling and kicking but little by little the old skin split in places and mr toad worked it off getting his hind legs free first and later his hands using the latter to pull the last of it from the top of his head over his eyes and as fast as he worked it loose he swallowed it now i feel better said he as with a final gulp he swallowed the last of his old suit tommy wasnt sure that he looked any better for the new skin looked very much like the old  but he didnt say so tommy found that he needed  good meals a day and filling his stomach took most of his time when he wasnt resting curms he found especially to his liking and it was astonishing how many he could eat in a night caterpillars of many kinds helped out and it was great fun to sit beside an anthill and snap up the busy workers as they came out but besides their daily foraging there was plenty of excitement as when a rustling warned them that a snake was near or a shadow on the grass told them that a hawk was sailing overhead at those times they simply sat perfectly still and looked so much like little lumps of earth that they were not seen at all or if they were they were not recognized instead of drinking they soaked water in through the skin to have a dry skin was to be terribly uncomfortable and that is why they always sought shelter during the sunny hours at last came a rainy day toad weather perfect toad weather exclaimed old mr toad this is the day to travel illustration toad weather perfect toad weather exclaimed old mr toad so once more they took up their journey in a leisurely way a little past noon the clouds cleared away and the sun came out bright time to get under cover grunted old mr toad and led the way to a great gray rock beside the l little path and crawled under the edge of it tommy was just going to followwhen something happened he wasnt a toad at alljust a frecklefaced boy sitting on the wishingst he pinched himself to make sure then he looked under the edge of the wishingst for old mr toad he wasnt there gradually he remembered that he had seen old mr toad disappearing around a turn in the l little path going hoppityhophophop as if he had something on his mind and i thought that there was nothing interesting about a toad muttered tommy i wonder if its all true i believe ill run down to the smiling pool and just see if that is where mr toad really was going he must have about reached there by this time he jumped to his feet and ran down the l little path as he drew near the smiling pool he stopped to listen to the joyous chorus rising from it he had always thought of the singers as just peepers or frogs now for the first time he noticed that there were different voices just ahead of him he saw something moving it was old mr toad softly very softly tommy followed and saw him jump into the shallow water carefully he tiptoed nearer and watched presently old mr toads throat began to swell and swell until it was bigger than his head then he began to sing it was only a couple of notes tremulous and wonderfully sweet and so expressive of joy and gladness that tommy felt his own heart swell with happiness it is true he cried and all the rest must be true and i said there was nothing beautiful about a toad when all the time he has the most wonderful eyes and the sweetest voice ive ever heard it must be true about that queer tongue and the way he sheds his skin im going to watch and see for myself why ive known old mr toad all my life and thought him just a common fellow when all the time he is just wonderful im glad ive been a toad of course there is nothing like being a boy but id rather be a toad than some other things ive been on the old wishingst im going to get all the toads i can to live in my garden this summer and that is just what tommy did with the result that he had  of the best gardens anywhere around and nobody knew why but tommyand his friends the toads tommy had no intention of doing any more wishing on that old st but he did he just couldnt keep away from it if you want to know what his wishes were and what more he learned you will find it in the next volume tommys wishes come true tommys wishes come true tommys wishes come true   why peter rabbit has  less enemy peter rabbit was happy there was no question about that you had only to watch him a few minutes to know it he couldnt hide that happiness any more than the sun at midday can hide when there are no clouds in the sky happiness seemed to fairly shoot from his long heels as they twinkled merrily this way and that way through the dear old briarpatch peter was doing crazy things he was so happy that he was foolish happiness you know is the only excuse for foolishness and peter was foolish very very foolish he would suddenly jump into the air kick his long heels dart off to  side change his mind and dart the other way run in a circle and then abruptly plump himself down under a bush and sit as still as if he couldnt move then without any warning at all he would cut up some other funny antic he was so foolish and so funny that finally tommy who unseen by peter was watching him laughed aloud perhaps peter doesnt like being laughed at most people dont it may be peter was a little bit uncertain as to why he was being laughed at anyway with a sudden thump of his stout hindfeet he scampered out of sight along  of his private little paths which led into the very thickest tangle in the dear old briarpatch ill have to come over here with my gun and get that rabbit for my dinner said tommy as he trudged homeward probably though if i have a gun i wont see him at all its funny how a fellow is forever seeing things when he hasnt got a gun and when he goes hunting he never sees anything tommy had come to the great gray st which was his favorite restingplace he sat down from sheer force of habit somehow he never could get past that st without sitting on it for a few minutes it seemed to just beg to be sat on he was still thinking of peter rabbit i wonder what made him feel so frisky thought tommy then he laughed aloud once more as he remembered how comical peter had looked it must be fun to feel as happy as all that without once thinking of where he was tommy exclaimed aloud i declare i wish i were a rabbit he was his wish had come true just as quick as that he found himself a rabbit you see he had been sitting on the wishingst if he had remembered perhaps he wouldnt have wished but he had forgotten and now here he was looking as if he might very well be own brother to peter rabbit not only did he look like peter but he felt like him anyway he felt a crazy impulse to run and jump and do foolish things and he did them he just couldnt help doing them it was his way of showing how good he felt just as shouting is a boys way and singing is the way of a bird but in the very midst of  of his wildest whirls he heard a sound that brought him up short as still as a st it was the sound of a heavy thump and it came from the direction of the old briarpatch tommy didnt need to be told that it was a signal a signal from peter rabbit to all other rabbits within hearing distance he didnt know just the meaning of that signal and because he didnt he just sat still now it happens that that was exactly what that signal meantto sit tight and not move peter had seen something that to him looked very suspicious so on general principles he had signaled and then had himself sat perfectly still until he should discover if there was any real danger tommy didnt know this but being a rabbit now he felt as a rabbit feels and from the second he heard that thump he was as frightened as he had been happy a minute before and being frightened yet not knowing of what he was afraid he sat absolutely still listening with all his might and looking this way and that as best he could without moving his head and all the time he worked his nose up and down up and down as all rabbits do and tested the air for strange smells presently tommy heard behind him a sound that filled him with terrible fear it was a loud sniff sniff rolling his eyes back so that he could look behind without turning his head he saw a dog sniffing and snuffing in the grass now that dog wasnt very big as dogs go but he was so much bigger than even the largest rabbit that to tommy he looked like a giant the terrible fear that filled him clutched at tommys heart until it seemed as if it would stop beating what should he do sit still or run somehow he was afraid to do either just then the matter was settled for him thump thump thump the signal came along the ground from the old briarpatch and almost any  would have known just by the short sharp sound that those thumps meant run at just the same instant the dog caught the scent of tommy full and strong with a roar of his great voice he sprang forward his nose in tommys tracks tommy waited no longer with a great bound he leaped forward in the direction of the old briarpatch how he did run a dozen bounds brought him to the old briarpatch and there just before him was a tiny path under the brambles he didnt stop to question how it came there or who had made it he dodged in and scurried along it to the very middle of the old briarpatch then he stopped to listen and look the dog had just reached the edge of the briars he knew where tommy had g of course he knew his nose told him that he thrust his head in at the entrance to the little path and tried to crawl in but the sly old brambles tore his long tender ears and he yelped with pain now instead of with the excitement of the chase then he backed out whining and yelping he ran around the edge of the old briarpatch looking for some place where he could get in more comfortably but there was no place and after a while he gave up and went off tommy sat right where he was until he was quite sure that the dog had g when he was quite sure he started to explore the dear old briarpatch for he was very curious to see what it was like in there he found little paths leading in all directions some of them led right through the very thickest tangles of ugly looking brambles and tommy found that he could run along these with never a fear of a single scratch and as he hopped along he knew that here he was safe absolutely safe from most of his enemies for no  bigger than he could possibly get through those briars without being terribly scratched so it was with a very comfortable feeling that tommy peered out through the brambles and watched that annoying dog trot off in disgust he felt that never so long as he was within running distance of the dear old briarpatch would he be afraid of a dog right into the midst of his pleasant thoughts broke a rude thump thump thump it wasnt a dangersignal this time that is it didnt mean run for your life tommy was very sure of that and yet it might be a kind of dangersignal too it all depended on what tommy decided to do there it was againthump thump thump it had an ugly threatening sound tommy knew just as well as if there had been spoken words instead of mere thumps on the ground that he was being warned to get out of the old briarpatchthat he had no right there because it belonged to some  else but tommy had no intention of leaving such a fine place such a beautifully safe place unless he had to and no mere thumps on the ground could make him believe that he could thump himself he did those long hindfeet of his were just made for thumping when he hit the ground with them he did it with a will and the thumps he made sounded just as ugly and threatening as the other fellows and he knew that the other fellow knew exactly what they meantill do as i please put me out if you can it was very clear that this was just what the other proposed to do if his thumps meant anything at all presently tommy saw a trim neatlooking rabbit in a little open space and it was something of a relief to find that he was about tommys own size if i cant whip him he certainly cant whip me thought tommy and straightway thumped im coming in reply to the strangers angry demand that he come out and fight now the stranger was n other than peter rabbit and he was very indignant he considered that he owned the dear old briarpatch he was perfectly willing that any other rabbit should find safety there in time of danger but when the danger was past they must get out tommy hadnt therefore he must be driven out now if tommy had been himself instead of a rabbit never never would he have dreamed of fighting as he was preparing to fight nowby biting and kicking particularly kicking but for a rabbit kicking was quite the correct and proper thing in fact it was the only way to fight so instead of coming together headon tommy and peter approached each other in queer little halfsidewise rushes each watching for a chance to use his stout hindfeet suddenly peter rushed jumped andwell when tommy picked himself up he felt very much as a boy feels when he has been tackled and thrown in a football game certainly peters hindlegs were in good working order just a minute later tommys chance came and peter was sent sprawling like a flash tommy was after him biting and pulling out little bunches of soft fur so they fought until at last they were so out of wind and so tired that there was no fight left in either then they lay and panted for breath and quite suddenly they forgot their quarrel each knew that he couldnt whip the other and that being so what was the use of fighting i suppose this old briarpatch is big enough for both of us said peter after a little ill live on  side and you live on the other replied tommy and so it was agreed in  things tommy found that as a rabbit he was not unlike tommy the boy these  were appetite curiosity and a decided preference for pleasure rather than work tommy felt as if he lived to eat instead of eating to live he wanted to eat most of the time it seemed as if he never could get his stomach really full there was  satisfaction and that was that he never had to look very far for something to eat there were clover and grass just outside the briarpatchall he wanted for the taking there were certain tenderleaved plants for a change not to mention tender bark from young trees and bushes with peter he made occasional visits to a not too distant garden where they fairly reveled in goodies illustration with peter he made visits to a garden these visits were in the nature of adventure it seemed to tommy that not even danny meadowmouse had so many enemies as he and peter had they used to talk it over sometimes it isnt fair said peter in a grieved t we dont hurt anybody we dont do the least bit of harm to any  and yet it isnt safe for us to play  minutes outside the dear old briarpatch without keeping watch no sir it isnt fair theres redtail the hawk watching this very minute from way up there in the sky he looks as if he were just sailing round and round for the fun of it but he isnt hes just watching for you or me to get  too many jumps away from these old briars then down hell come like a shot now what harm have we ever d redtail or any of his family tell me that of course tommy couldnt tell him that and so peter went on when i was a baby i came very near to finding out just how far it is from mr blacksnakes mouth to his stomach by the inside passage and all that saved me was the interference of a boy who set me free now that im grown im not afraid of mr blacksnakethough i keep out of his waybut i have to keep on the watch all the time for that boy the same  asked tommy the very same replied peter hes forever setting his dog after me and trying to get a shot at me with his terrible gun yet ive never d him any harmnor the dog either its very curious said tommy not knowing what else to say it seems to me there ought to be some time when it is reasonably safe for an hst rabbit to go abroad continued peter who now that he was started seemed bound to make the worst of his troubles at night i cannot even dance in the moonlight without all the time looking  way for reddy fox and another for hooty the owl its a good thing that the briarpatch is always safe said tommy because he could think of nothing else to say but it isnt snapped peter i wish to goodness it was now thereslisten peter sat very still with his ears pricked forward something very like a look of fear grew and grew in his eyes tommy sat quite as still and listened with all his might presently he heard a faint rustling it sounded as if it was in  of the little paths through the briarpatch yes it surely was and it was drawing nearer tommy gathered himself together for instant flight and a strange fear gripped his heart its billy mink gasped peter if he follows you dont run into a hole in the ground or into a hollow log whatever you do keep going hell get tired after a while there he isrun peter bounded off  way and tommy another after a few jumps tommy squatted to make sure whether or not he was being followed he saw a slim dark form slipping through the brambles and he knew that billy mink was following peter tommy couldnt help a tiny sigh of relief he was sorry for peter but peter knew every path and twist and turn while he didnt it was a great deal better that peter should be the  to try to fool billy mink so tommy sat perfectly still and watched he saw peter twist and turn run in a circle crisscross run back on his own trail and make a break by leaping far to  side he saw billy mink follow every twist and turn his nose in peters tracks when he reached the place where peter had broken the trail he ran in ever widening circles until he picked it up again and once more peter was on the run tommy felt little cold shivers chase up and down his back as he watched how surely and persistently billy mink followed and thenhe hardly knew how it happenedpeter had jumped right over him and there was billy mink coming there was nothing to do but run and tommy ran he doubled and twisted and played all the tricks he had seen peter play and then at last when he was beginning to get quite tired he played the same trick on peter that had seemed so dreadful when peter played it on him he led billy mink straight to where peter was sitting and once more peter was the hunted but billy mink was getting tired after a little he gave up and went in quest of something more easily caught peter came back to where tommy was sitting billy minks a tough customer to get rid of al but with some  to change off with it is no trick at all said he it wouldnt work so well with his cousin shadow the weasel hes the  i am afraid of i think we should be safer if we had some new paths what do you think tommy confessed that he thought so too it would have been very much easier to have dodged billy mink if there had been a few more cross paths we better make them before we need them more than we did this time said peter and as this was just plain sound rabbit common sense tommy was forced to agree and so it was that he learned that a rabbit must work if he would live long and be happy he didnt think of it in just this way as he patiently cut paths through the brambles and tangles of bush and vine it was fear just plain fear that was driving him and even this drove him to work only by spells between times when he wasnt eating he sat squatting under a bush just lazily dreaming but always ready to run for his life in the moonlight he and peter loved to gambol and play in some open space where there was room to jump and dance but even in the midst of these joyous times they must need sit up every minute or so to stop look and listen for danger it was at night too that they wandered farthest from the old briarpatch once they met bobby coon and peter warned tommy never to allow bobby to get him cornered and once they met jimmy skunk who paid no attention to them at all but went right on about his business it was hard to believe that he was another to be warned against but so peter said and peter ought to know if anybody did so tommy learned to be ever on the watch he learned to take note of his neighbors he could tell by the sound of his voice when sammy jay was watching reddy fox and when he saw a hunter when blacky the crow was on guard he knew that he was reasonably safe from surprise at least once a day but more often several times a day he had a narrow escape but he grew used to it and as soon as a fright was over he forgot it it was the only way to do as he learned more and more how to watch and to care for himself he grew bolder curiosity led him farther and farther from the briarpatch and then  day he discovered that reddy fox was between him and it there was nothing to do but to run and twist and double and dodge every trick he had learned he tried in vain he was in the open and reddy was too wise to be fooled illustration reddy fox was between him and his castle he was right at tommys heels now and with every jump tommy expected to feel those cruel white teeth just ahead was a great rock if he could reach that perhaps there might be a crack in it big enough for a frightened little rabbit to squeeze into or a hole under it where he might find safety he was almost up to it would he be able to make it  jump he could hear reddy panting  jumps he could feel reddys breath  jumps he was on the rock andslowly tommy rubbed his eyes reddy fox was nowhere to be seen of course not no fox would be foolish enough to come near a boy sitting in plain sight tommy looked over to the old briarpatch that at least was real slowly he walked over to it peering under the bushes he saw peter rabbit squatting perfectly still yet ready to run you dont need to peter said he you dont need to you can cut  boy off that long list of enemies you are always watching for you see i know just how you feel peter he walked around to the other side of the briarpatch and stooping down thumped the ground once with his hand there was an answering thump from the spot where he had seen peter rabbit tommy smiled were friends peter said he and its all on account of the wishingst ill never hunt you again my i wouldnt be a rabbit for anything in the world being a boy is good enough for me   why tommy became a friend of red squirrels i dont see what sis wants to string this stuff all over the house for just because it happens to be christmas grumbled tommy as he sat on a big st and idly kicked at a pile of beautiful groundpine and fragrant balsam boughs its the best day for skating weve had yet and here i am missing a whole morning of it and so tired that most likely i wont feel like going this afternoon now tommy knew perfectly well that if his mother said that he could go nothing could keep him away from the pond that afternoon he was a little tired perhaps but not nearly so tired as he tried to think he was gathering christmas greens was work of course but when you come right down to it there is work about almost everything even skating the chief difference between work and pleasure is the difference between must and want to when you must do a thing it becomes work when you want to do a thing it becomes pleasure right down deep inside where his hst self lives tommy was glad that there was going to be a green wreath in each of the front windows and that over the doors and pictures there would be sweetsmelling balsam without them why christmas wouldnt be christmasy at all and really it had been fun gathering those greens he wouldnt admit it but it had he wouldnt have missed it for the world it was only that it had to be d just when he wanted to do something else and so he tried to feel grieved and persecuted and to forget that christmas was only  days off he sat on the big gray st and looked across the green meadows no longer green but covered with the whitest and lightest of snowblankets across the old pasture not  whit less beautiful to the green forest and he sighed it was a deep heavy sigh it was the sigh of a selfmade martyr as if in reply he heard the sharp voice of chatterer the red squirrel it rang out clear and loud on the frosty air and it was very plain that whatever troubles others might have chatterer was very well satisfied with the world in general and himself in particular just now he was racing along the fence stopping at every post to sit up and tell all the world that he was there and didnt care who knew it presently his sharp eyes spied tommy chatterer stopped short in the middle of a rail and looked at tommy very hard then he barked at him jerking his tail with every syllable tommy didnt move chatterer jumped down from the fence and came nearer every foot or so he paused and barked and his bark was such a funny mixture of nervousness and excitement and curiosity and sauciness not to say impudence that finally tommy laughed right out he just couldnt help it back to the fence rushed chatterer and scampered up to the top of a post once sure of the safety of this retreat he faced tommy and began to scold as fast as his tongue could go of course tommy couldnt understand what chatterer was saying but he could guess he was telling tommy just what he thought of a boy who would sit moping on such a beautiful day and only  days before christmas at that my how his tongue did fly when he had had his say to the full he gave a final whisk of his tail and scampered off in the direction of the old orchard and as he went it seemed to tommy as if he looked back with the sauciest kind of a twinkle in his eyes as much as to say you deserve all ive said but i dont really mean it tommy watched him a lively little red spot against the white background and as he watched the smile gradually faded away it never would do at all to go home in good spirits after raising such a fuss as he had when he started out so to make himself feel as badly as he felt that he ought to feel tommy sighed dolefully oh but youre lucky said he as chatterers sharp voice floated over to him from the old orchard you dont have to do a blessed thing unless you want to all you have to do is to eat and sleep and have a good time it must be fun i wish i were a squirrel right then something happened it happened all in a flash just as it had happened to tommy before  minute he was a boy a discontented boy sitting on a big gray st on the edge of the green meadows and the next minute he wasnt a boy at all you see when he made that wish he had quite forgotten that he was sitting on the wishingst now he no longer had to guess at what chatterer was saying not a bit of it he knew he talked the same language himself in short he was a red squirrel and in  minutes had forgotten that he ever had been a boy how good it felt to be free and know that he could do just as he pleased his first impulse was to race over to the old orchard and make the acquaintance of chatterer then he thought better of it something inside him seemed to tell him that he had no business therethat the old orchard was not big enough for  red squirrels and that as chatterer had g there first it really belonged to him in a way he felt quite sure of it when he had replied to chatterers sharp voice and had been told in no uncertain ts that the best thing he could do would be to run right back where he had come from of course he couldnt do that so he decided to do the next best thingrun over to the green forest and see what there was to do there he hopped up on the rail fence and whisked along the top rail what fun it was he didnt have a care in the world all he had to do was to eat drink and have a good time ha who was that coming along behind him was it chatterer it looked something like him yet different somehow tommy sat quite still watching the stranger and as he watched a curious terror began to creep over him the stranger wasnt chatterer no indeed he wasnt even a squirrel he was too long and slim and his tail was different he was shadow the weasel tommy didnt have to be told that although he never had seen shadow before he knew without being told for a minute he couldnt move then his heart beating with fear until it seemed as if it would burst he fled along the fence toward the green forest and now he didnt stop at the posts when he came to them his  thought was to get away away as far as ever he could for in the eyes of shadow the weasel he had seen death up the nearest tree he raced and hid clinging close to the trunk near the top staring down with eyes fairly bulging with fright swiftly yet without seeming to hurry shadow the weasel came straight to the tree in which tommy was hiding his nose in tommys tracks in the way that a hound follows a rabbit or a fox at the foot of the tree he stopped just a second and looked up then he began to climb at the first scratch of his claws on the bark tommy raced out along a branch and leaped across to the next tree then in a great panic he went on from tree to tree taking desperate chances in his long leaps in the whole of his little being he had room for but  feeling and that was fearfear of that savage pitiless pursuer he had run a long way before he realized that he was no longer being followed the fact is shadow had found other game easier to catch and had given up now just as soon as tommy realized that shadow the weasel was no longer on his track he straightway forgot his fear in fact it was just as if he never had had a fright for that is the law of mother nature with her little people of the wild so presently tommy was once more as happy and carefree as before in a big chestnuttree just ahead of him he could see happy jack the gray squirrel and happy jack was very busy about something perhaps he had a storehouse there the very thought made tommy hungry once more he hid but this time not in fear he hid so that he could watch happy jack not a sound did he make as he peered out from his hidingplace happy jack was a long time in that hollow limb it seemed as if he never would come out so tommy started on to look for more mischief for he was bubbling over with good spirits and felt that he must do something presently quite by accident he discovered another hoard of nuts mostly acorns neatly tucked away in a crotch of a big tree of course he sampled them what fun thought he i dont know who they belong to and i dont care from now on they are going to belong to me he started to carry them away but a sudden harsh scream close to him startled him so that he dropped the nut he had in his mouth he dodged behind the trunk of the tree just in time to escape the dash of an angry bird in a brilliant blue suit with white and black trimmings illustration a sudden harsh scream startled him so that he dropped the nut thief thief thief leave my acorns al screamed sammy jay anger making his voice harsher than ever round and round the trunk of the tree tommy dodged chattering back in reply to the sharp tongue of the angry bird it was exciting without being very dangerous after a while however it grew tiresome and watching his chance he slipped over to another tree and into a hole made by drummer the woodpecker sammy jay didnt see where he had disappeared and after hunting in vain gave up and began to carry his acorns away to a new hidingplace tommys eyes sparkled with mischief as he watched by and by he would have a hunt for it it would be fun when sammy jay had hidden the last acorn and flown away tommy came out he didnt feel like hunting for those acorns just then so he scampered up in a tall hemlocktree and just out of sheer good spirits and because he could see no danger near he called sharply that all within hearing might know that he was about almost instantly he received a reply from not far away it was an angry warning to keep away from that part of the green forest because he had no business there it was the voice of chatterer tommy replied just as angrily that he would stay if he wanted to then they barked and chattered at each other for a long time gradually chatterer came nearer finally he was in the very next tree he stopped there long enough to tell tommy all that he would do to him when he caught him and at the end he jumped across to tommys tree tommy waited no longer he wasnt ready to fight in the first place he knew that chatterer probably had lived there a long time and so was partly right in saying that tommy had no business there then chatterer looked a little the bigger and stronger so tommy nimbly ran out on a branch and leaped across to the next tree in a flash chatterer was after him and then began a most exciting race through the treetops tommy found that there were regular squirrel highways through the treetops and along these he raced at top speed chatterer at his heels scolding and threatening when he reached the edge of the green forest tommy darted down the last tree across the open space to the old st wall and along this chatterer following suddenly the anger in chatterers voice changed to a sharp cry of warning tommy scrambled into a crevice between  sts without stopping to inquire what the trouble was when he peeped out he saw a great bird sailing back and forth in a few minutes it alighted on a nearby tree and sat there so still that if tommy had not seen it alight he never would have known it was there mr goshawk nearly got you that time said a voice very near at hand tommy turned to find chatterer peeping out from another crevice in the old wall it wont be safe for us to show ourselves until he leaves continued chatterer its getting so that an hst squirrel needs eyes in the back of his head to keep his skin whole not to mention living out his natural life hello here comes a boy and that means more trouble theres  good thing about it and that is hell frighten away that hawk tommy looked and sure enough there was a boy and in his hands was an airrifle tommy didnt know what it was but chatterer did i wish that hawk would hurry up and fly so that we can run he sputtered the thing that boy carries throws things and they hurt it isnt best to let him get too near when he has that with him he seems to think its fun to hurt us id just like to bite him once and see if he thought that was fun there goes that hawk come on now weve got to run for it chatterer led the way and tommy followed he was frightened but there wasnt that terror which had possessed him when shadow the weasel was after him something struck sharply against the wall just behind him it frightened him into greater speed something struck just in front of him and then something hit him so hard that just for a second he nearly lost his balance it hurt dreadfully hurrah shouted the boy i hit him that time then the boy started to run after them so as to get a closer shot well get up in the top of that big hemlocktree and he wont be able to see us panted chatterer did he hit you thats too bad it might have been worse though if he had had  of those things that make a big noise and smoke we might not either of us be here now boys are hateful things i dont see what fun they get out of frightening and hurting such little folks as you and me theyre brutes thats what they are when we get across that little open place we can laugh at him come on now down from the end of the old wall chatterer jumped and raced across to the foot of a big hemlocktree tommy at his heels up the tree they ran and hid close to the trunk where the branches were thick they could peer down and see the boy but he couldnt see them he walked around the tree  or  times and then shot up into the top to try to frighten the squirrels dont move whispered chatterer he doesnt see us tommy obeyed although he felt as if he must run his heart seemed to jump every time a bullet spatted in among the branches it was dreadful to sit there and do nothing while being shot at and not know but that the very next minute  of those little lead shot would hit tommy knew just how it would hurt if it did hit presently the boy gave up and went off to torment some  else no sor was his back fairly turned than chatterer began to scold and jeer at him tommy joined him it was just as if there never had been any danger if that boy could have understood what they said his ears would have burned then chatterer showed tommy just what part of the green forest he claimed as his own and also showed him a part that had belonged to another squirrel to whom something had happened and suggested that tommy take that for his it wasnt as good as chatterers but still it would do very well tommy took possession at once each agreed not to intrude on the others territory on common ground that didnt belong to either of them they would be the best of friends but tommy knew that if he went into chatterers part of the green forest he would have to fight and he made up his mind that if any other squirrel came into his part of the green forest there would be a fight suddenly he was very jealous of his new possession he was hardly willing to leave it when chatterer suggested a visit to a nearby corncrib for a feast of yellow corn chatterer led the way tommy found that he was quite lame from the shot which had hit him but he was soon racing after chatterer again along the old st wall then along a fence up a mapletree and from there to the roof of the corncrib they scampered chatterer knew just where to get inside and in a few minutes they were stuffing themselves with yellow corn when they had eaten all that they could hold they stuffed their cheeks full and started back the way they had come tommy went straight to his own part of the green forest and there he hid his treasure some in a hollow stump and some under a little pile of leaves between the roots of a tree all the time he watched sharply to make sure that no  saw him while looking for new hidingplaces his nose told him to dig there buried under the leaves he found nuts hidden by the  who had lived there before him there must be many more hidden there and it would be great fun hunting for them doubtless he would find as many as if he had hidden them himself for he had seen that chatterer didnt know where he had put a tenth part of the things he had hidden he just trusted to his nose to help him get them again he found a splendid nest made of leaves and strips of inner bark in the hollow stub of a big branch of a chestnuttree and he made up his mind that there was where he would sleep then he ran over to see chatterer again he found him scolding at a cat who watched him with yellow unblinking eyes chatterer would run down the trunk of the tree almost to the ground and there scold and call names as fast as his tongue could go then he would run back up to the lowest branch and scold from there the next time he would go a little farther down finally he leaped to the ground and raced across to another tree the cat sprang but was just too late chatterer jeered at her then he began the same thing over again and kept at it until finally the cat gave up and left in disgust it had been exciting but tommy shivered at the thought of what might have happened ever try that with a fox asked chatterer no replied tommy i have boasted chatterer but ive seen squirrels caught doing it he said still i suppose  may as well be caught by a fox as by a hawk did you see that weasel this morning asked tommy chatterer actually shivered as he replied yes i saw him after you its a wonder he didnt get you youre lucky i was lucky myself this morning for a mink went right past where i was hiding life is nothing but  jump after another these days it seems as if when  has worked as hard as i did last fall to store up enough food to keep me all winter i ought to be allowed to enjoy it in comfort those who sleep all winter like johnny chuck have a mighty easy time of it they dont know when they are well off still id hate to miss all the excitement and fun of life i would rather jump for my life twenty times a day as i have to and know that im alive than to be alive and not know it see that dog down there i hate dogs im going to tell him so off raced chatterer to bark and scold at a little blackandwhite dog which paid no attention to him at all the shadows were creeping through the trees and tommy began to think of his nest he looked once more at chatterer who was racing along the top of the old wall scolding at the dog suddenly what seemed like merely a darker shadow swept over chatterer and when it had passed he had vanished for once that fatal once he had been careless hooty the owl had caught him tommy shivered he was frightened and cold he would get to his nest as quickly as he could he leaped down to a great gray st andbehold he wasnt a squirrel at all he was just a boy sitting on a big st with a heap of christmas greens at his feet he shivered for he was cold then he jumped up and stamped his feet and threshed his arms a million diamond points glittered in the white meadows where the snow crystals splintered the sunbeams from the old orchard sounded the sharp scolding chirr and cough of chatterer the red squirrel tommy listened and slowly a smile widened hooty didnt get you after all he muttered then in a minute he added im glad of it and you havent anything more to fear from me you wont believe it but you havent you may be mischievous but i guess you have troubles enough without me adding to them oh but im glad im not a squirrel being a boys good enough for me specially long bout christmas time i guess sis will be tickled with these greens but its queer what happens when i sit down on this old rock he frowned at it as if he couldnt understand it at all then he gathered up his load of greens and with the merriest of whistles trudged homeward and to this day chatterer the red squirrel cannot understand how it came about that from that christmas he and tommy became fast friends but they did perhaps the wishingst could tell if it would   the pleasures and troubles of bobby coon tommy was trudging down to the cornfield and his freckled face was rather sober at least it was sober for him considering why he was on his way to the cornfield it wasnt to work if it had been his sober look would have been quite easy to understand the fact is tommy was going on an errand that once would have filled him with joy and sent him whistling all the way coons are raising mischief down in the corn youd better get your traps out and see if you can catch the thieving little rascals go down and look the ground over and see what you think his father had said to him at noon that day so here he was on his way to look for signs of bobby coon and if the truth were known actually hoping that he wouldnt find them there had been a time when he would have been all excitement over his quest and eager to find the telltale tracks where bobby coon went into and out of the cornfield then he would have hurried home for his traps in great glee or instead would have planned to watch with his gun for bobby that very night but now he had no such feelings somehow he had come to regard his little wild neighbors in a wholly different light he no longer desired to do them harm ever since he had begun to learn what their real lives were like by wishing himself  of them as he sat on the old wishingst he had cared less and less to hunt and frighten them and more and more to try to make friends with them his teacher would have said that he had a sympathetic understanding of them and then probably would have had to explain to tommy what that meantthat he knew just how they felt and had learned to look at things from their point of view and it was true he had put away his gun and traps he no longer desired to kill he liked to hunt for these little wild people as much as ever perhaps more but it was in order to make friends with them and to find out more about their ways and habits instead of to kill them so it was that he didnt like his present errand on the brow of the hill that overlooked the cornfield he stopped for a minute to look down on the broad acres of longleaved stalks standing row on row row on row like a well drilled army he thought of the long hours he had spent among them toiling with his hoe in the hot sunshine when the swimminghole was calling to him and a sudden sense of pride swept over him the great sturdy plants no longer needed his hoe to keep the weeds down the ears had filled out and were in the milk now seems as if we could spare what little a coon wants muttered tommy as he gazed down on the field of course if there is a whole family of em somethings got to be d but i dont believe  coon can eat enough to do much harm dad promised me a share in the crop when its harvested to pay for my work it isnt likely to be very much and goodness knows i want every penny of it but i guess if that coon isnt doing too much damage i can pay for it tommys face lighted up at the idea it was going to take selfdenial on his part but it was a way out the thought chased the soberness from his face and put a spring into his hitherto reluctant steps he went at once to that part of the cornfield nearest the green forest it did not take him long to discover the evidences that a raccoon or perhaps more than  had been taking toll here a stalk less sturdy than its neighbors had been pulled down the husks stripped from the ears and a few mouthfuls of the milky grains taken there a stalk had been climbed and an ear stripped and bitten into wasteful little beggar muttered tommy why cant you be content to take an ear at a time and clean it up then there would be no kick coming dad wouldnt mind if you filled your little tummy every night if you didnt spoil ten times as much as you eat ha here are your tracks now well see where you come in except for the sharp tips of the toes the tracks were not unlike the print of a tiny hand and there was no mistaking them for the tracks of any other animal tommy studied them until he was sure that all were made by  raccoon and he was convinced that he had but  to deal with at length he found the place where the animal was in the habit of entering the field there was just the suggestion of a path through the grass in the direction of the green forest it was very clear that bobby coon came and went regularly that way and of course this was the place to set a trap tommys face clouded again at the thought i believe ill go up to the old wishingst and think it out he muttered so he headed for the familiar old wishingst that overlooked the green meadows and the cornfield and was not so very far from the green forest and when he reached it he sat down it is doubtful if tommy ever got past that old st without sitting down on it this time he had no intention of wishing himself into anything yet hardly had he sat down when he did you see his thoughts were all of bobby coon and so without stopping to think where he was he said to no  in particular there are some things i want to know about raccoons i wish i could be  long enough to find out tommys wish had come true he was no longer tommy the boy but tommy the coon he was a thickset rather clumsylooking graycoated fellow with a black ringed tail and a black band across the eyes his ears were sharp and his face was not unlike that of reddy fox in its outline his toes were long and bare and when he walked it was with his whole foot on the ground as a man does and as a bear does in fact although he didnt know it he was own cousin to buster bear tommys home was a hollow tree with the entrance high up inside he had a comfortable bed and there he spent his days sleeping away the long hours of sunshine night was the time he liked best to be abroad and then he roamed far and wide without fear reddy fox he was not afraid of at all in fact there was no  he feared much but man and in the darkness of the night he thought he need not even fear him tommys hollow tree was in a swamp through which flowed a brook and it was tommys delight to explore this brook sometimes up sometimes down in it were fish to be caught and tommy as a boy never delighted in fishing more than did tommy as a coon on moonlight nights he would steal softly up to a quiet pool and on the very edge of it possess himself in patience as a good fisherman should presently a careless fish would swim within reach a swift scoop with a black little paw with five sharp little hooks extendedand the fish would be high and dry on the shore it was great fun sometimes he would visit marshy places where the frogs were making the night noisy with a mighty chorus this was the easiest kind of hunting he had only to locate the spot from which  of those voices issued steal softly up and there was  less singer though the voice would hardly be missed in the great chorus occasionally he would take a hint from jerry muskrat and where the water was very shallow dig out a few mussels or freshwater clams at other times just by way of varying his bill of fare he would go hunting this was less certain of results but exciting and when successful the reward was great especially was this so in the nesting season and many a good meal of eggs did tommy have to say nothing of tender young birds occasionally he prowled through the treetops in hope of surprising a family of young squirrels in their sleep n knew better than he that in the light of day he could not catch them but at night when they could not see and he could it was another matter but fish meat and eggs were only a part of tommys diet fruit berries and nuts in their season were quite as much to his liking not to mention certain tender roots  day quite by chance while he was exploring a hollow tree he discovered that it already had tenants and that they were makers of the most delicious sweets he ever had tasted in short he almost made himself sick on wild hy his long hair protecting him from the little lances of the bees after that he kept a sharp eye out for sweets and so discovered that bumblebees make their nests in the ground and that while they contained a scant supply of hy there was enough as a rule to make it worth while to dig them open so tommy grew fat and lazy there was plenty to eat without working very hard for it and he shuffled about in the green forest and along the laughing brook eating whatever tempted him and having a good time generally he dearly loved to play along the edge of the water and was as tickled as a child with anything bright and shiny once he found a bit of tin shining in the moonlight and spent most of the remainder of that night playing with it about  thing he was very particular if he had meat of any kind and there was water near he always washed it carefully before eating in fact tommy was very neat it was born in him sometimes daylight caught him far from his hollow tree then he would look for an old nest of a hawk or crow and curl up in it to sleep the day away if n was handy and he could find no hollow tree or stump he would climb a big tree and stretch himself flat along  of the big limbs and there sleep until the black shadows came creeping through the green forest once in a while he would be discovered by the sharp eyes of sammy jay or blacky the crow and then life would be made miserable for him until he would be glad to wake up and seek some hidingplace where they could not see him it was for this reason chiefly that he always tried to get back to his own snug den by the time jolly round red mr sun shook his rosy blankets off and began his daily climb up in the blue blue sky illustration once in a while he would be discovered  night he met bobby coon himself where do you live asked tommy over on the mountain replied bobby in a hollow tree asked tommy no oh my no replied bobby ive got the nicest den in a ledge of rock no more hollow trees for me why not demanded tommy they arent safe retorted bobby i used to live in a hollow tree but ive learned better i guess youve never been hunted when youve been nearly choked to death by smoke in your hollow tree or had it cut down with you in it and barely escaped by the skin of your teeth you wont think so much of hollow trees give me a good rocky den every time but where does the smoke come from and why should my hollow tree be cut down asked tommy to whom this was all new and very strange hunters replied bobby briefly you wait until the cool weather comes and youll find out what i mean but who are the hunters and what do they hunt us for persisted tommy my but you are innocent retorted bobby they are those legged creatures called men and i dont know what they hunt us for they just do thats all they seem to think its fun i wish  of them would have to fight for his life perhaps he wouldnt see so much fun in it then it was last fall that they drove me out of my hollow tree and they pretty nearly got me too but they wont do it this year you take my advice and get a den in the rocks then you can laugh at them but what will they hunt me for i havent d them any harm persisted tommy that doesnt have anything to do with it retorted bobby they do it for fun have you tried the corn yet its perfectly delicious come on and well have a feast now of course tommy was ready for a feast the very thought of it put everything else out of his head he shuffled along behind bobby coon through the green forest across a little stretch of meadow and under the bars of a fence into a cornfield for a minute he sat and watched bobby it was tommys first visit to a cornfield and he didnt know just what to do but bobby did oh yes bobby did he stood up on his hind legs and pulled  of the more slender stalks down until he could get at the lowest ear then he stripped off the husk and took a huge bite of the tender milky kernels ummm said bobby coon and took another tommy waited no longer he found a stalk for himself and  minutes later he was stuffing himself with the most delicious meal he ever had tasted at least he thought so then he forgot all about dens and hunters he had no thought for anything but the feast before him here was plenty and to spare he dropped the ear he was eating and climbed a big stalk to strip another ear the first  was good but this  was better perhaps a third would be better still so he sampled a third the moon flooded the cornfield with silvery light it was just the kind of a night that all raccoons love and in that field of plenty bobby and tommy were perfectly happy they did not know that they were in mischief how should they the corn was no more than other green things growing of which they were free to help themselves so they wandered about taking here a bite and there a bite and wasting many times as much as they ate suddenly in the midst of their good time there sounded the yelp of a dog and there was something about it that sent a chill of fright along tommys backb it was an excited and joyous yelp and yet there was something threatening in it it was followed by another yelp and then another each more excited than the others and then it broke into a fullthroated roar in which there was something fierce and terrifying it was coming nearer through the corn tommy looked over to where he had last seen bobby coon he wasnt there but a rustling of the cornstalks beyond told him that bobby was running running for his life tommy was in a panic he never had had to run for his life before where should he go to the green forest of course where there were trees to climb in a tree he would be safe then he heard another sound the shout of a man he remembered what bobby coon had said about trees and a new fear took possession of him while he still hesitated the dog passed only a few yards away in the corn tommy heard the rustle of the stalks and the roar of his savage voice and then suddenly he knew that the dog was not after him he was following the tracks of bobby coon swiftly tommy stole through the corn and ran across the bit of meadow his heart in his mouth to the great black bulk of the green forest he ran swiftly surprisingly so for such a clumsylooking fellow how friendly the tall trees looked they seemed to promise safety it was hard to believe that bobby coon was right and that they did not he kept on nor stopped until he was in his own hollow tree the voice of the dog came to him growing fainter and fainter in the direction of the mountain and finally ceased altogether he wondered if bobby reached his den and was safe of  thing tommy was certain that cornfield was no place for him so he kept away from it and tried not to think of how good that milky corn had tasted so the summer passed and the fall came with falling leaves and sharp frosty nights they gave tommy even more of an appetite though there had been nothing the matter with that before he grew fatter and fatter so that it made him puff to run unknown to him old mother nature was preparing him for the long winter sleep by this time the memory of the dog and of what bobby coon had said about hollow trees had almost dropped from his mind he was concerned over nothing but filling his stomach and enjoying those frosty moonlight nights he interfered with no  and no  interfered with him  night he had g down to the laughing brook fishing without warning there broke out on the still air the horrid sound of that yelping dog tommy listened for just a minute this time it was his trail that dog was following there could be no doubt about it tommy turned and ran swiftly but he was fat and heavy and he could hear the dog gaining rapidly straight for his hollow tree fled tommy and even as he reached it the dog was almost at his heels up the tree scrambled tommy and from the safe vantage of a big limb which was the threshold of his home he looked down the dog was leaping up against the base of the tree excitedly and his voice had changed he was barking a feeling of relief swept over tommy the dog could not climb he was safe but presently there were new sounds in the green forest the shouting of men lights twinkled and drew nearer staring down from the edge of his hole tommy saw eager cruel faces looking up with a terrible fear gripping his heart he crept down into his bed presently the tree shook with the jar of an ax blow followed blow the tree vibrated to each blow and the vibrations passed through tommys body so that it shook but it shook still more with a nameless and terrible fear at last there was a sharp cracking sound tommy felt himself falling through space he remembered what bobby coon had told him and he wondered if he would be lucky enough to escape as bobby did then he shut his eyes tight waiting for the crash when the tree should strike the ground when he opened his eyes he wasjust tommy sitting on the wishingst overlooking the green meadows his face was wet with perspiration was it from the sun beating down upon him or was it from the fear that had gripped him when that tree began to fall a shudder ran over him at the memory he looked over to the cornfield where he had found the tracks of bobby coon and the mischief he had wrought what was he to do about it somehow strangely his sympathy was with bobby he doesnt know any better muttered tommy he thinks that corn belongs to him as much as to anybody else and there isnt any reason why he shouldnt think so it isnt fair to trap him or kill him for something he doesnt know he shouldnt do if he just knew enough to eat what he wants and not waste so much i guess there wouldnt be any trouble hes just like a lot of folks who have so much they dont know what to do with it only they know better than to waste it and he doesnt i know what ill do ill take bowser down there tonight and give him a scare ill give him such a scare that he wont dare come back until the corn is so hard he wont want it thats what ill do my it must be awful to think youre safe and then find youre trapped i guess i wont ever hunt coons any more i used to think it was fun but i never thought how the coon must feel now i know andandwell a live coon is a lot more interesting than a dead  anyway funny what i find out on this old wishingst if i keep on i wont want to hunt anything any more tommy got up stretched began to whistle as if there was a load off his mind and started for home still whistling and his whistle was good to hear   how tommy envied honker the goose the feel of spring was in the air the sound of it filled tommys ears the smell of it filled his nostrils and caused him to take long deep breaths the sight of it gladdened his eyes and the joy of it thrilled his heart for the spring you know has really arrived only when it can be felt heard smelled and seen and has the power to fill all living things with abounding joy and happiness winter had been long in going it seemed to tommy that it never would go he liked winter oh yes tommy liked winter he liked to skate and slide to build snow forts and houses and make snow men he liked to put on his snowshoes and tramp through the green forest for many are the secrets of the summer which the winter reveals to those with eyes to see and tommy was trying to train his eyes to be of that kind but when it was time for winter to go he wanted it to go quickly and it hadnt it had dragged on and dragged on to be sure there had been a few springlike days but they had been only an aggravation but this day was different and tommy knew that at last spring had arrived it was not that it was long past time for it was now almost april it was something more it was just a something that throbbing all through him told him that this time there was no mistakespring was really here there was a softness in the touch of gentle sister southwind which was like a caress from over in the green forest came the gurgle of the laughing brook and mingling with it was the soft whistle of winsome bluebird the cheery song of welcome robin the joyous greeting of little friend the songsparrow the clear lilt of carol the meadowlark the sweet love call of tommy tit the chickadee and under all a subdued murmur sensed rather than really heard as of a gentle stirring of reawakened life so tommy heard the spring and in each long breath he drew there was the odor of damp warm soil such as the earth gives up only at this season and so tommy smelled the spring and looking from the top of the hill above the wishingst down across the green meadows to the old pasture and beyond to the purple hills he saw all as through a soft and beautiful haze which was neither fog nor smoke but as if old mother nature had drawn an exquisite veil over the face of the earth until it should be made beautiful and so tommy saw the spring he whistled joyously as he tramped down to the dear old wishingst and sat down on it his hands clasped about his crossed knees seasons came and went but the wishingst the great gray st which overlooked the green meadows remained always the same how many many winters it must have seen go and how many many springs it must have seen come some early and some like this  late but all beautiful in all the years it had been there how many of old mother natures children little people in fur little people in feathers little people in scaly suits and little people with neither fur nor feathers nor scales but with gauzy or beautifully colored wings or crawling with many feet must have rested there just as he was doing now somehow tommy always got to thinking of these little people whenever he sat on the wishingst from it he had watched many of them and learned much of their ways but he had learned still more by wishing that seems queer but it was so he had wished that he was a meadowmouse and no sor had he wished it than he had been  in turn he had wished himself into a red squirrel a rabbit and a mink and he had lived their lives had learned how they work and play how sometimes they have plenty but quite as often go hungry sometimes very hungry and how always they are under the shadow of fear and the price of life is eternal watchfulness i suppose some people would say that i fell asleep and dreamed it all but i know better said tommy if they were dreams why dont i have the same kind at home in bed but its only out here on this old st when i wish i were something that i become it so of course it isnt a dream now i think of it every single time ive wished myself  of these little animals it has been because i thought they had a better and an easier time than i do and every time ive been mighty glad that im just what i am i wonder he paused a minute for a sudden thought had popped into his head i wonder he finished if those wishes came true just to teach me not to be discontented i wonder if a wish would come true if i werent discontented he was still wondering when floating down out of the sky came a clear honk honk honk khonk honk honk khonk instantly tommy turned his freckled face and eager eyes skyward wild geese he exclaimed honk honk khonk honk the sound was loud and clear but it seemed to come from nowhere in particular and everywhere in general of course it came from somewhere up in the sky but it was very hard to place it as from any particular part it was a good  minutes before tommys eyes sharp as they were found what he was looking fora black wedge moving across the sky a wedge made up of little black living spots at least they looked little that was because they were so high so very high in the sky he knew that each of those black spots was a great broadwinged birda canada goose he could see the long outstretched necks as tiny black lines  behind another in  long lines which met in a letter v like welldrilled soldiers maintaining perfect formation the leader at the apex of the v and behind him each bird a given distance from the  in front they moved steadily across the sky straight into the north honk honk khonk honk khonk khonk honk there was something indescribably thrilling in the sound it made the blood leap and race through tommys veins long after the living wedge had passed beyond his vision those clarion notes rang in his earshonk honk khonk honk khonk khonk honk they were at once a challenge and a call to the wild freedom of the great wilderness they filled his heart with a great longing it swelled and pulsed with a vast desire oh he sighed it must be great to be able to fly like that i would rather fly than do anything i know of i envy old honker in the lead there i do i wish i could join him this very minute of course that wish had slipped out unthinkingly but that made no difference tommy had wished and now here he was high in the air no longer a boy but a great bird the last  in a long line of great birds beating the thin air with stout tireless wings as they followed honker the leader straight into the north far far below lay the great world it seemed to tommy that he had no part in it now a fierce tumultuous joy surged through him and demanded expression spring had come and he must tell those plodding creatures mere specks crawling on the distant earth honk honk khonk honk khonk never in all his life had tommy felt such a thrill as possessed him now looking down he saw brown meadows and pastures showing just a hint of green here and there green forests and bare woodlands silver threads which he knew to be rivers shining spots which were lakes and ponds and villages which looked like toys once they passed over a great city but it did not look great at all seen through the murk of the smoke from many factory chimneys it was not unlike an anthill which had been openedtiny black objects which were really men women children horses and motorcars seeming to hurry aimlessly in all directions for all the world like ants so all day they flew crying the glad message of the spring to the crawling things below just a little while before the setting of the sun honker the leader slanted down toward a shining spot in the heart of a great forest and the others followed rapidly the shining spot grew in size until below them lay a pond far from the homes of men and to the very middle of this honker led the way while the whole flock broke into excited gabbling for they had flown far and were tired with a splash honker struck the water and with splash after splash the others followed tommy the last because you know he was at the end of  of those long lines then for a while they rested the wise old leader scanning the shores with keen eyes for possible danger satisfied that all was well he gave a signal and led the way to a secluded cove where the water was shallow and the shore marshy it was clear that he had been there before and had come with a purpose slowly they swam honker well in the lead necks held high the eyes of all alert and studying the nearing shore there was no honking now not a sound to tommy in his inexperience such watchfulness seemed needless what possible danger could there be in such a lly place but he wisely kept his place and did as the others did at length they were close to shore and honker gave a low signal which meant that all was well instantly the formation was broken and with a low contented gabbling the flock began feeding on eelgrass roots and sedges from the mud at the bottom for an hour they fed then they swam about or sat on the shore preening their feathers while the shadows deepened but all the time honker and some of the older ganders with eyes and ears alert were on guard and when at last tommy put his head under his wing to sleep a great content filled his heart illustration honker on the watch the next day was much like the first with break of day they had breakfasted and then at a signal from honker they had mounted up up into the blue vault and all day they had heralded the spring to the earth below as they flew into the north so it was the next day and the next wise old honker leading them to some chosen secluded restingplace each night gradually the face of the earth below changed there were no more cities the villages became smaller and farther between and at last they saw no more only here and there a lly farm great forests and lakes succeeded each other the air grew colder but with his thick coat of feathers tommy minded it not at all then  day they found they had outflown the spring below them the earth was still frozen and snowcovered the ponds and lakes were still icebound reluctantly honker turned back to their last stoppingplace and there for a week they rested in peace and security though not in contentment for the call of the north the far north with its nestinggrounds was ever with them and made them impatient and eager to be on their way the daily flights were shorter now and there were frequent rests of days at a time for spring advanced slowly and they must wait for the unlocking of the lakes and rivers the forests changed the trees became low and stunted at last they came to a vast region of bogs and swamps and marshes around shallow lakes and ponds a great lly wilderness a mighty solitude at least that is what tommy would have thought it had he been a boy or a man instead of a smart young gander it was neither lly nor a solitude to him now but the haven which had been the object of those hundreds of miles of strongwinged flight it was the nestingground it was home and how could it be lly with flock after flock of his own kind coming in every hour of every day with thousands of ducks pouring in in swift winged flight and countless smaller birds all intent on homebuilding the flock broke up into pairs each intent on speedily securing a home of their own on the ground they made great nests of small sticks and dead grass with a soft lining of down in each presently were  or five big eggs and soon there were downy goslingsscores and scores of themin the water with their mothers for the first swimming lesson then the old birds had to be more vigilant than before for there were dangers many of them even in that far wilderness prowling foxes hungry lynxes crafty mink hawks fierce owls each watching for the chance to dine on tender young goose so the summer short in that far northern region passed and the young birds grew until they were as large as their parents and able to care for themselves cold winds swept down out of the frozen arctic ocean with warning that already winter had begun the southward march then began a great gathering of the geese and a dividing into flocks each with a chosen leader chosen for his strength his wisdom and his ability to hold his leadership against all comers many a battle between ambitious young ganders and old leaders did tommy see but he wisely forbore to challenge old honker the leader who had led the way north and when the latter gathered the flock for the journey he was  of the first to fall in line a thousand plus a thousand miles and more stretched before them as they turned to the south but to the strength of their broad wings the distance was as nothing but this was to be a very different journey from their trip north as tommy soon found out then they had been urged on day by day by a great longing to reach their destination now in place of longing was regret there was no joy in the going they were going because they must they had no choice winter had begun its southward march the flights were comparatively short for where food was good they stayed until some subtle sense warned old honker that it was time to be moving it was when they had left the wilderness and reached the great farmlands that they lingered longest there in the stubble of the grain fields was feed aplenty and every morning at dawn and again every afternoon an hour or so before sundown honker led the way to the fields during the great part of the day and all night they rested and slept on the bar of a river or well out on the bosom of a lake it was now that tommy learned a new respect for the cunning of the wise old leader and also that terrible fear which comes sor or later to all wild creaturesthe fear of man time and again as they approached their chosen feedingground there would come a sharp signal from honker and he would abruptly turn the direction of the flight and lead them to another and much poorer feedingground yet look as he would tommy could see no cause no danger at first tommy thought it was because other geese seemed to have reached the feedingground first he could see them standing stiffly as if watching the newcomers near them a harmless little heap of straw he knew that the feeding was better there and he wanted to go but the spirit of obedience was strong within him and he followed with the rest once he voiced his disapproval to another bird as they settled some distance away where it was more work to find the scattered grain watch he replied in a low t there comes a flock led by that young upstart who fought and defeated his old leader the day before we left home he is leading them straight over there tommy watched suddenly from that harmlesslooking little heap of straw there sprang  spurts of flame followed by  sharp reports that struck terror to his heart even as he beat his way into the air he looked and saw that foolish young leader and  of his flock falling stricken and helpless to the earth and a man leap from under the straw to pick them up then he understood and a new loyalty to old honker grew in his heart but in spite of the everpresent danger honker kept his flock there for food was good and plentiful and he had faith in himself and his flock had faith in him so they lingered until a driving snow squall warned them that they must be moving keeping just ahead of the oncoming winter they journeyed south and at every stoppingplace they found men and guns waiting there was no little pond so lly but that death might be lurking there sometimes the call of their own kind would come up to them looking down they would see geese swimming in seeming security and calling to them to come down and join them more than once honker set his wings to accept the invitation only to once more beat his way upward as his keen eyes detected something amiss on the shore and so tommy learned the baseness of man who would use their own kind to decoy them to death came at last a sudden swift advance of cold weather which forced them to fly all night when day broke they were weary of wing and worse the air was thick with driving snow for the first time tommy beheld honker uncertain he still led the flock but he led he knew not where for in the driving snow n could see low they flew now but a little way above the earth making little progress against the driving storm and so weary of wing that it was all they could do to keep their heavy bodies up it was then that the welcome honk of other geese came up to them and heading in the direction of the calling voices and honking back their distress they discovered water below and gladly oh so gladly set their wings and dropped down into this haven of refuge hardly had the first s hit the water when bang bang bang bang the fateful guns roared and when out of the confusion into which they were thrown they once more gathered behind their old leader far out in the middle of the pond some of the flock were missing in clear weather they flew high and it happened on such a day that as tommy looked down there stirred within him a strange feeling below stretched a green forest with broad meadows beyond and farther still an old brushgrown pasture somehow it was wonderfully familiar eagerly he looked there should be something more ah there it wasan old gray boulder overlooking the meadows like a magnet it seemed to draw tommy down to itself honk honk honk khonk tommy heard the call of his old leader faintly as if from a distance honk honk honk khonk honk khonk honk tommy opened his eyes and rubbed them confusedly where was he honk honk honk khonk honk khonk he looked up there high in the blue sky was a living wedge pointing straight into the north and the joy of the spring was in the wild clamor that came down to him slowly he rose from the old wishingst and with his hands thrust in his pockets watched the flock until it was swallowed up in the distant haze long he stood gazing through unseeing eyes while the wild notes still came to him faintly and the joy of them rang in his heart but there was no longing there now only a vast content it must be great to fly like that he murmured it must be great but he drew a long breath as he looked over the meadows to the old pasture and heard and saw and felt the joy of the springthis is good enough for me he finished i dont envy that old leader a bit it may be glorious to be wild and free to look down and see the great world and all that but its more glorious to be safe and carefree andand just a boy no i dont envy old honker a little bit but isnt he wonderful ii dont see what men want to hunt him for and try to kill him they wouldnt if they knew how wonderful he is i never will no sir i never will i know how it feels to be hunted andand its dreadful thats what it isdreadful i know and its all because of the old wishingst im glad i know andandgee im glad its spring honk honk honk khonk honk khonk another flock of geese were passing over and tommy knew that they too were glad oh so glad that it was spring  of tommys acquaintances reddy fox and jerry muskrat he thought he knew all about but he found that there was much he didnt know and there were  who live deep in the great woods whom he had never seen paddy the beaver and buster bear so to the friendly old wishingst tommy went and what he learned there you may learn from the next volume tommys change of heart tommys change of heart tommys change of heart   how it happened that reddy fox gained a friend it was funny that tommy never could pass that gray st without sitting down on it for a few minutes it seemed as if he just couldnt that was all it had been a favorite seat ever since he was big enough to drive the cows to pasture and go after them at night it was just far enough from home for him to think that he needed a rest when he reached it you know a growing boy needs to rest often except when he is playing he used to take all his troubles there to think them over the queer part of it is he left a great many of them there though he didnt seem to know it if tommy ever could have seen in  pile all the troubles he had left at that old gray st i am afraid that he would have called it the troublest instead of the wishingst it was only lately that he had begun to call it the wishingst several times when he had been sitting on it he had wished foolish wishes and they had come true at least it seemed as if they had come true they had come as true as he ever wanted them to he was thinking something of this kind now as he stood idly kicking at the old st presently he stopped kicking at it and from force of habit sat down on it it was a bright sunshiny day  of those warm days that sometimes happen right in the middle of winter as if the weatherman had somehow got mixed and slipped a spring day into the wrong place in the calendar from where he sat tommy could look over to the green forest which was green now only where the pinetrees and the hemlocktrees and the sprucetrees grew all the rest was bare and brown save that the ground was white with snow he could look across the white meadowland to the old pasture where in places the brush was so thick that in summer he sometimes had to hunt to find the cows now even from this distance he could trace the windings of the cowpaths each a ribbon of spotless white it puzzled him at first he scowled at them when the whole thing is covered with snow it ought to be harder to see those paths but instead of that it is easier he muttered it isnt reasonable he scowled harder than ever but the scowl wasnt an unpleasant  you know there is a difference in scowls some are black and heavy like ugly thunderheads and from them flashes of anger are likely to dart any minute just as the lightning darts out from the thunderheads others are like the big fleecy clouds that hide the sun for a minute or  and make it seem all the brighter by their passing there are scowls of anger and scowls of perplexity it was a scowl of the latter kind that wrinkled tommys forehead now he was trying to understand something that seemed to him quite beyond common sense it isnt reasonable he repeated i ought not to be able to see em at all but i do they stick out like no  will ever know just what they stuck out like for tommy never finished that sentence the scowl cleared and his freckled face fairly beamed he had made a discovery all by himself and he felt all the joy of a discoverer perhaps you will think it wasnt much but it was really important so far as it concerned tommy because it proved that tommy was learning to use his eyes and to understand what he saw he had reasd the thing out and when anybody does that it is always important why how simple exclaimed tommy of course i can see those old paths it would be funny if i couldnt the bushes break through the snow on all sides but where the paths are there is nothing to break through and so they are perfectly smooth and stand right out queer i never noticed that before hello whats that his sharp eyes had caught sight of a little spot of red up in the old pasture it was moving and as he watched it it gradually took shape it was reddy fox trotting along  of those little white paths apparently reddy was going to keep an engagement somewhere for he trotted along quite as if he were bound for some particular place and had no time to waste hes headed this way and if i keep still perhaps hell come close thought tommy so he sat as still as if he were part of the old wishingst itself reddy fox came straight on at the edge of the old pasture he stopped for a minute and looked across to the green forest as if to make sure that it was perfectly safe to cross the green meadows evidently he thought it was for he resumed his steady trot if he kept on the way he was headed he would pass very near to the wishingst and to tommy just as he was halfway across the meadows chanticleer tommys prize plymouth rock rooster crowed over in the farmyard instantly reddy stopped with  black paw uplifted and turned his head in the direction of the sound tommy could imagine the hungry look in that sharp crafty face but reddy was far too wise to think of going up to the farmyard in broad daylight and in a moment resumed his journey nearer and nearer he came until he was passing not thirty feet away how handsome he was his beautiful red coat looked as if the coldest wind never could get through it his great plume of a tail black toward the end and just tipped with white was held high to keep it out of the snow his black stockings white vest and blacktipped ears gave him a wonderfully fine appearance quite a dandy is reddy fox and he looked it he was almost past when tommy squeaked like a mouse like a flash reddy turned his sharp ears cocked forward his yellow eyes agleam with hunger there he stood as motionless as tommy himself eagerness written in every line of his face it was very clear that no matter how important his business in the green forest was he didnt intend knowingly to pass anything so delicious as a meadowmouse again tommy squeaked instantly reddy took several steps toward him looking and listening intently a look of doubt crept into his eager face that old gray st didnt look just as he remembered it for a long minute he stared straight at tommy then a puff of wind fluttered the bottom of tommys coat and perhaps at the same time it carried to reddy that dreaded man smell reddy almost turned a backsomersault in his hurry to get away then he ran how he did run in almost no time at all he had reached the green forest and vanished from tommys sight quite without knowing it tommy sighed my how handsome he is you know tommy is frecklefaced and rather homely and gee how he can run he added admiringly it must be fun to be able to run like that it might be fun to be a fox anyhow i wonder what it feels like i wish i were a fox illustration then he ran how he did run if he had remembered where he was perhaps tommy would have thought twice before wishing but he had forgotten forgetting was  of tommys besetting sins hardly had the words left his mouth when tommy found that he was a fox redcoated blackstockingedthe very image of reddy himself and with that change in himself everything else had changed it was summer the green meadows and the green forest were very beautiful even the old pasture was beautiful but tommy had no eyes for beauty all that beauty meant nothing to him save that now there was plenty to eat and no great trouble to get it everywhere the birds were singing but if tommy heeded at all it was only to wish that some of the sweet songsters would come down on the ground where he could catch them those songs made him hungry he knew of nothing he liked better next to fat meadowmice than birds that reminded him that some of them nest on the ground mrs grouse for instance he had little hope that he could catch her for it seemed as if she had eyes in the back of her head but she should have a family by this time and if he could find those youngstersthe very thought made his mouth water and he started for the green forest once there he visited  place after another where he thought he might find mrs grouse he was almost ready to give up and go back to the green meadows to hunt for meadowmice when a sudden rustling in the dead leaves made him stop short and strain his ears there was a faint kwitt and then all was still tommy took  or  steps and thencould he believe his eyesthere was mrs grouse fluttering on the ground just in front of him  wing dragged as if broken tommy made a quick spring and then another somehow mrs grouse just managed to get out of his way but she couldnt fly she couldnt run as she usually did it was only luck that she had managed to evade him very stealthily he approached her as she lay fluttering among the leaves then gathering himself for a long jump he sprang once more he missed her by a mere matter of inches it seemed the same thing happened again and still again it was maddening to have such a good dinner so near and yet not be able to get it then something happened that made tommy feel so foolish that he wanted to sneak away with a roar of wings mrs grouse sailed up over the treetops and out of sight huh havent you learned that trick yet said a voice tommy turned there was reddy fox grinning at him what trick he demanded why that old grouse was just fooling you replied reddy there was nothing the matter with her she was just pretending she had a whole family of young s hidden close by the place where you first saw her my but you are easy lets go right back there cried tommy no use not the least bit declared reddy its too late lets go over on the meadows and hunt for mice together they trotted over to the green meadows all through the grass were private little paths made by the mice the grass hung over them so that they were more like tunnels than paths reddy crouched down by  which smelled very strong of mouse tommy crouched down by another presently there was the faint sound of tiny feet running the grass moved ever so little over the small path reddy was watching suddenly he sprang and his  black paws came down together on something that gave a pitiful squeak reddy had caught a mouse without even seeing it he had known just where to jump by the movement of the grass presently tommy caught  the same way then because they knew that the mice right around there were frightened they moved on to another part of the meadows i know where there are some young woodchucks said tommy who had unsuccessfully tried for  of them that very morning where demanded reddy over by that old tree on the edge of the meadow replied tommy it isnt the least bit of use to try for them they dont go far enough away from their hole and their mother keeps watch all the time there she is now sure enough there sat old mrs chuck looking at that distance for all the world like a stake driven in the ground come on said reddy well have  of those chucks but instead of going toward the woodchuck home reddy turned in quite the opposite direction tommy didnt know what to make of it but he said nothing and trotted along behind when they were where reddy knew that mrs chuck could no longer see them he stopped theres no hurry said he there seems to be plenty of grasshoppers here and we may as well catch a few when mrs chuck has forgotten all about us well go over there tommy grinned to himself if he thinks we are going to get over there without being seen hes got something to learn thought tommy but he said nothing and for lack of anything better to do he caught grasshoppers after a while reddy said he guessed it was about time to go chuckhunting you go straight over there said he when you get near mrs chuck will send all the youngsters down into their hole and then she will follow only shell stay where she can peep out and watch you go right up to the hole so that she will go down out of sight and then wait there until i come ill hide right back of that tree and then you go off as if you had given up trying to catch any of them go hunt meadowmice far enough away so that she wont be afraid ill do the rest tommy didnt quite see through the plan but he did as he was told as he drew near mrs chuck she did just as reddy said she wouldsent her youngsters down underground then as he drew nearer she followed them tommy kept on right up to her doorstep the smell of those chucks was maddening he was tempted to try to dig them out only somehow he just felt that it would be of no use he was still half minded to try however when reddy came trotting up and flattened himself in the long grass behind the trunk of the tree tommy knew then that it was time for him to do the rest of his part he turned his back on the woodchuck home and trotted off across the meadow he hadnt g far when looking back he saw mrs chuck sitting up very straight and still on her doorstep watching him not once did she take her eyes from him tommy kept on and presently began to hunt for meadowmice but he kept  eye on mrs chuck and presently he saw her look this way and that as if to make sure that all was well then she must have told her children that they could come out to play once more for out they came by this time tommy was so excited that he almost forgot that he was supposed to be hunting mice presently he saw a red flash from behind the old tree there was a frightened scurry of little chucks and old mrs chuck dove into her hole reddy barked joyfully tommy hurried to join him reddy had been quite as successful as he had boasted he would be and was grinning didnt i tell you wed have chuck for dinner said reddy what  cant do  can after that tommy and reddy often hunted together and reddy taught tommy many things so the summer passed with plenty to eat and nothing to worry about not once had he known that terrible fearthe fear of being huntedwhich is so large a part of the lives of danny meadow mouse and peter rabbit and even chatterer the red squirrel instead of being afraid he was feared he was the hunter instead of the hunted day and night for he was abroad at night quite as much as by day he went where he pleased and did as he pleased and was happy for there was nothing to worry him having plenty to eat he kept away from the homes of men he had been warned that there was danger there at last the weather grew cold there were no more grasshoppers there were no more foolish young rabbits or woodchucks or grouse for those who had escaped had grown up and were wise and smart every day it grew harder to get enough to eat the cold weather made him hungrier than ever and now he had little time for sunnaps or idle play he had to spend most of the time that he was awake hunting he never knew where the next meal was coming from as did thrifty striped chipmunk and happy jack squirrel and danny meadow mouse it was hunt hunt hunt and a meal only when his wits were sharper than the wits of those he hunted he knew now what real hunger was he knew what it was most of the time so when late  afternoon he surprised a fat hen who had strayed away from the flock behind the barn of a lly farm he thought that never had he tasted anything more delicious thereafter he visited chickenhouses and stole many fat pullets to him they were no more than the wild birds he hunted only more foolish and so easily caught and then  morning after a successful raid on a poultryhouse he heard for the first time the voices of dogs on his trail he the hunter was being hunted at first it didnt bother him at all he would run away and leave them far behind so he ran and when their voices were faint and far away he lay down to rest but presently he grew uneasy those voices were drawing nearer those dogs were following his every twist and turn with their noses in his tracks just as he had so often followed a rabbit for hours he ran and still those dogs followed he was almost ready to drop when he chanced to run along in a tiny brook and after he left that he heard no more of the dogs that day so he learned that running water broke his trail the next day the dogs found his trail again and as he ran from them through a swamp there was a sudden flash and a dreadful noise something stung him sharply on the shoulder as he looked back he caught a glimpse of a man with something in his hands that looked like a stick with smoke coming from the end of it that night as he lay licking his wounds he knew that now he who had known no fear would never again be free from itthe fear of man little by little he learned how to fool and outwit the dogs he learned that water destroyed his scent he learned that dry sand did not hold it he learned to run along st walls and then jump far out into the field and so break his trail he learned that if he dashed through a flock of sheep the foolish animals would rush around in aimless fright and their feet would stamp out his trail these and many other sharp tricks he learned so that after a while he had no fear of the dogs but his fear of man grew greater rather than less and was with him at all times so all through the fall he hunted and was hunted then came the snow the beautiful white snow all day it fell and when at night the moon came out the earth was covered with a wonderful white carpet through the green forest and over the meadows tommy hunted  l shivering little woodmouse he dug out of a moldering old stump but this was only a bite he visited  henhouse after another only to find each without so much as a loose board by means of which he might get in it was dreadful to be so hungry as if this were not enough the breaking of the day brought the sound of dogs on his trail ill fool them in short order thought he alas running in the snow was a very different matter from running on the bare ground  trick after another he tried the very best he knew the s which never had failed before but all in vain wherever he stepped he left a footprint plain to see though he might fool the noses of the dogs he could not fool the eyes of their masters now  thing he had long ago learned and this was never to seek his underground den unless he must for then the dogs and the hunters would know where he lived so now tommy ran and ran hoping to fool the dogs but not able to at last he realized this and started for his den he felt that he had to running in the snow was hard work his legs ached with weariness his great plume of a tail of which he was so proud was a burden now it had become wet with the snow and so heavy that it hampered and tired him a great fear a terrible fear filled tommys heart would he be able to reach that snug den in time he was panting hard for breath and his legs moved slower and slower the voices of the dogs seemed to be in his very ears glancing back over his shoulder he could see them gaining with every jump the fierce joy of the hunt and the lust of killing in their eyes he knew now the feeling the terror and dreadful hopelessness of the meadowmice and rabbits he had so often run down just ahead was a great gray rock from it he would make  last long jump in an effort to break the trail in his fear he quite forgot that he was in plain sight now and that his effort would be useless up on the rock he leaped wearily andtommy rubbed his eyes then he pinched himself to make quite sure that he was really himself he shivered for he was in a cold sweatthe sweat of fear before him stretched the snowcovered meadows and away over beyond was the old pasture with the cowpaths showing like white ribbons halfway across the meadows running toward him with their noses to the ground and making the echoes ring with the joy of the hunt were  hounds a dark figure moving on the edge of the old pasture caught his eyes and held them it was a hunter reddy fox handsome crafty reddy into whose hungry yellow eyes he had looked so short a time before would soon be running for his life hastily tommy jumped to his feet and hurried over to the trail reddy had made as he ran for the green forest with eager feet he kicked the snow over those telltale tracks for a little way he waited for those eager hounds and when they reached the place where he had broken the trail he drove them away they and the hunter might pick up the trail again in the green forest but at least reddy would have time to get a long start of them and a good chance of getting away altogether then he went back to the wishingst and looked down at it thoughtfully and i actually wished i could be a fox he exclaimed my but im glad im not i guess reddy has trouble enough without me making him any more he may kill a lot of innocent little creatures but he has to live and its no more than men do he was thinking of the chicken dinner he would have that day im going straight over to the old pasture and take up that trap i set yesterday i guess a boys troubles dont amount to much after all im more glad than ever that im a boy andandwell if reddy fox is smart enough to get  of my chickens now and then hes welcome it must be awful to be hungry all the time   tommy becomes a furry engineer paddy the beaver lives in the great woods far from the dwellingplace of man often and often had tommy wished that paddy lived in the green forest near his home that he might make his acquaintance for he had read many wonderful things about paddy and they were hard to believe if i could see em for myself just see em with my own eyes i could believe but so many things are written that are not true that a feller doesnt know what to believe and what not to a feller ought to see things to know that they are so said tommy as he strolled down towards the big gray st that overlooked the green meadows course its easy enough to believe that beavers build houses muskrats do that i know all about muskrats and i spose a beavers house is about the same thing as a muskrats only bigger and better but how any animal can cut down a big tree or build a dam or dig a regular canal is more than i can understand without seeing for myself i wish tommy didnt finish his wish i suspect he was going to wish that he could go into the great woods and hunt for paddy the beaver but he didnt finish his wish because just then a new thought popped into his head you know how it is with thoughts they just pop out from nowhere in the queerest way it was so now with tommy he suddenly thought of the wishingst the great gray st just ahead of him and he wondered if he should sit down on it if he could wish himself into a beaver always before when he had wished himself into an animal or a bird it was  of those with which he was familiar and had seen this case was different there were no beavers anywhere near where tommy lived and so he was a little doubtful if he could wish himself into a beaver why he could wish himself into anythinga lion or an elephant or anything elseand learn about all the animals no matter where they lived gee exclaimed tommy and there was a queer little catch in his breath because you know it was such a big idea he stood still and slowly rubbed the bare toes of  foot up and down the other bare brown leg gee he exclaimed again and stared very hard at the wishingst nt do any harm to try it anyway he added so he walked over to the wishingst and sat down with his chin in his hands and his elbows on his knees he stared over at the green forest and tried to imagine that it was the great woods where the only human beings ever seen were hunters or trappers or lumbermen and where bears and deer and moose and wolves lived and where beavers built their homes and made their ponds and lived their lives far from the homes of men as he stared the green forest seemed to change to the great woods i wish said he slowly and dreamily i wish that i were a beaver he was no longer sitting on the wishingst he was a young beaver with a waterproof fur coat a broad flat tail and great chisellike teeth in the front of his jaws his tools his home was in the heart of the great woods where a broad shallow brook sparkled and dimpled and the sun breaking through the treetops kissed its ripples in places it flowed swiftly dancing and singing over sts and pebbles again it lingered in deep dark cool holes where the trout lay farther on it loafed lazily through wild meadows where the deer delighted to come but where tommy was it rested in little ponds quiet peaceful in a dreamy stillness where the very spirit of peace and happiness and contentment seemed to brood on  side of  of these little ponds was the house a great house of sticks bound together with mud and turf the house in which tommy lived with others of his family it was quite the finest beaverhouse in all that region but tommy didnt think anything about that it was summer now the season of play of having a good time without thought of work it was the season of visiting and of exploration in company with some of his relatives he made long journeys up and down the brook and even across to other brooks on some of which were other beaver colonies and on some of which were no signs that beavers ever had worked there but when summer began to wane tommy found that life was not all a lazy holiday and that he was expected to work the home settlement was rather crowded there was danger that the food supply would not be sufficient for so many hungry beavers so it was decided to establish a new settlement on  of the brooks which they had visited in their summer journey and tommy was  of a little company which under the leadership of a wise old beaver started forth on a still night to found the new colony he led the way straight to  of the brooks on the banks of which grew many aspen trees for you must know that the favorite food of beavers is the bark of aspens and poplars it was very clear that this wise old leader had taken note during the summer of those trees and of the brook itself for the very night of their arrival he chose a certain place in the brook and announced that there they would build their dam isnt it a great deal of work to build a dam asked tommy who knew nothing about dambuilding the dam at his old home having been built long before his time illustration isnt it a great deal of work to build a dam it is yes indeed it certainly is replied an old beaver youll find it so before we get this dam built then whats the use of building it asked tommy i dont see the use of a dam here anyway there are places where the banks are steep enough and the water deep enough for splendid holes in which to live then all weve got to do is to go cut a tree when we are hungry im sure i for  would much rather swim around and have a good time the other looked at him out of eyes that twinkled and yet in a way to make tommy feel uncomfortable you are young said he and the prattle of young tongues is heedless what would you do for food in winter when the brook is frozen the young think only of today and the good times of today and forget to prepare for the future when you have learned to work you will find that there is in life no pleasure so great as the pleasure of work well d now suppose you let us see what those teeth of yours are good for and help cut these alders and haul them over to the place where the dam is to be tommy had no reply ready and so he set to work cutting young alders and willows as the rest were doing these were floated or dragged down to the place chosen for the dam where the water was very shallow and were laid side by side with the big ends pointing up stream turf and sts and mud were piled on the brushy ends to keep them in place so the foundations of the dam were laid from bank to bank then more poles were laid on top and more turf and mud short sticks were wedged in between and helped to hold the long sticks in place tommy grew tired of working but no  else stopped and he was ashamed to  of his companions cut a big poplar and others helped him trim off the branches this was for food and when the branches and trunk had been stripped of bark they were floated down to the new dam and worked into it the trunk being cut into lengths which could be managed easily thus nothing went to waste so all through the stilly night they worked and when the day broke they sought the deep water and certain holes under the banks wherein to rest but before he left the dam the wise old leader examined the work all over to make sure that it was right when the first shadows crept forth late the next afternoon the old leader was the first back on the work  by  the others joined him and another night of labor had begun some cut trees and saplings some hauled them to the dam and some dug up turf and mud and piled it on the dam there was no talking everybody was too busy to talk illustration some cut trees and saplings some hauled them to the dam most of tommys companions had helped build dams before and knew just what to do tommy asked no questions but did as the others did slowly the dam grew higher and tommy noticed that the brook was spreading out into a pool for the water came down faster than it could work its way through that pile of poles and brush twigs and leaves and grass floated down from the places higher up where the beavers were at work and when these reached the dam they were carried in amongst the sticks by the water and lodged there helping to fill up the holes and hold the water back as night after night the dam grew higher and the pool behind it grew broader and deeper tommy began to take pride in his work he no longer thought of play but was as eager as the others to complete the dam the stars looked down from the soft sky and twinkled as they saw the busy workers at last the dam was completed for the time being at least very thoroughly the wise old leader went all over it inspecting it from end to end and when he was satisfied he led his band to  side of the little pond formed by the dam and there he chose a site for the house wherein they would spend the winter first a platform of sticks and mud and turf was built until it was a few inches above the water then began the raising of the walls a mass of brush and turf until the walls were  feet thick and so solid that jack frost would find it quite useless to try to get inside the roof was in the shape of a rough dome and at the top was comparatively thin here little or no mud was used so that there were tiny airholes for like all other warmblooded animals a beaver must breathe within was a comfortable room of which the platform was the floor from this  burrows or tunnels led down on the deepwater side  of these being on a gradual incline that food sticks might the easier be dragged in the entrances to both were at the very bottom of the pond where there would be no danger of them being closed by ice when the pond should freeze in winter these were the only entrances so that no foe could reach them unless he were able to swim under water and there were no such swimmers whom they had cause to fear when the house was finished tommy thought that their labors would be at an end and he was almost sorry for he had learned to love work but no sor was the house completed than all the beavers went lumbering yes sir that is just what they did they went lumbering just as men do only they cut the trees for food instead of for boards they began at the edge of a little grove of aspens to which the pond now nearly extended sitting on his haunches with his broad tail for a seat or a prop as his fancy pleased each little woodsman grasped the tree with his hands and bit into the trunk a bite above and a bite below and then with his teeth pried out the chip between the  bites exactly as a man with an ax would cut it was slow hard work cutting out a chip at a time in this way but sor or later the tree would begin to sway a bite or  more and it would begin to topple over then the little workman would thud the ground sharply with his tail to warn his neighbors to get out of the way and he himself would scamper to a place of safety while the tree came crashing down tommy dearly loved to see and hear those trees come crashing to the ground no sor was a tree down than they trimmed off the branches and cut the trunk into short lengths these logs they rolled into the water where with the larger branches they were floated out to deep water close by the house and there sunk to the bottom what for tommy didnt have to be told this was the beginning of their foodpile for the winter so the days slipped away and the great foodpile grew in the pond with such busy workers it did not take long to cut all the trees close by the pond the farther away from the water they got the greater the labor of dragging and rolling the logs and also the greater danger from lurking enemies in the water they felt wholly safe but on land they had to be always on the watch for wolves and bears and lynxes when they had reached the limit of safety the wise old leader called a halt to tree cutting and set them all to digging and what do you think it was they were digging why a canal it was easier and safer to lead the water from the pond to the place where the trees grew than to get the logs over land to the pond so they dug a ditch or canal about  and a half feet wide and a foot and a half deep piling the mud up on the banks until at last it reached the place where they could cut the trees and roll the logs into the canal and so float them out to the pond then the cutting began again tommy was happy never had he been more happy there was something wonderfully satisfying in just looking at the results of their labor and in feeling that he had had a part in it all yet his life was not all labor without excitement indeed it was far from it had tommy the beaver been able to remember what as tommy the boy he had read he would have felt that he was just like those hardy piers who built their homes in the wilderness always in that great still wilderness death with padded feet and cruel teeth and hungry eyes sought to steal upon the beavers so always as they worked especially when on the land they were prepared to rush for safety at the first warning never for a minute did they cease to keep guard testing every breath of air with wonderfully sensitive noses and listening with hardly less wonderful ears on nose and ears the safety of a beaver almost wholly depends his eyes being rather weak once tommy stopped in his labor of cutting a big tree so that he might rest for a minute or  on the very edge of the little clearing they had made the moonlight fell on an old weathergray log tommy stared at it a moment then resumed his work a few minutes later he chanced to look at it again somehow it seemed nearer than before he stared long and hard but it lay as motionless as a log should once more he resumed his work but hardly had he d so when there was the warning thud of a neighbors tail instantly tommy scrambled for the water and even as he did so he caught a glimpse of that gray old log coming to life and leaping toward him the instant he reached the water he dived what was it he whispered tremulously when in the safety of the house he touched noses with  of his neighbors tufty the lynx was the reply i smelled him and gave the warning i guess it was lucky for you that i did i guess it was returned tommy with a shiver another time a huge black form sprang from the blacker shadows and caught  of the workers it was a bear sometimes there would be  or  alarms in a night so tommy learned that the harvesting of the food supply was the most dangerous labor of all for it took him farthest from the safety of the water at last this work was completed and tommy wondered if now they were to rest and idle away their time but he did not have to wonder long the old leader was not yet content but must have the pond deepened all along the foot of the dam and around the entrances to the house so now they once more turned to digging this time under water bringing the mud up to put on the dam or the house some working on  and some on the other the nights grew crisp and there was a hint of frost it was then that they turned all their attention to the house plastering it all over with mud save at the very top where the airholes were so thick did they lay it on that only here and there did the end of a stick project then came a night which made a thin sheet of ice over the pond and froze the mudplaster of the house the cold increased the ice grew thicker and the walls of the house so hard that not even the powerful claws of a bear could tear them open it was for this that that last coating of mud had been put on the nights of labor were over at last there was nothing to do now but sleep on the soft beds of grass or of thin splinters of wood for some had preferred to make beds of this latter material for exercise they swam in the quiet waters under the ice when they were hungry they slipped down through the water tunnel and out into the pond swam to the foodpile got a stick and took it back to the house where they gnawed the bark off in comfort and at their ease afterward carrying the bare stick down to the dam for use in making repairs once they discovered that the water was rapidly lowering this meant a break in the dam a trapper had cut a hole in it and cunningly placed a trap there but the wise old leader knew all about traps and the breach was repaired without harm to any  sometimes a lynx or a wolf would come across the ice and prowl around the house sniffing hungrily as the smell of beaver came out through the tiny airholes in the roof but the thick walls were like rock and tommy and his companions never even knew of these hungry prowlers peace safety and contentment reigned under the ice of the beaverpond but at last there came a day when a great noise reverberated under the ice they knew not what it meant and lay shivering with fear a long time they lay even after it had ceased then  of the boldest went for a stick from the foodpile he did not return another went and he did not return finally tommy went for he was hungry when he reached the foodpile he found that it had been fenced in with stout poles driven down into the mud through holes cut in the ice it was the cutting of these holes that had made the dreadful noise though tommy didnt know it around the foodpile he swam until at last he found an opening between the poles of the fence he hesitated then because he was very hungry he entered hardly was he inside when another pole was thrust down through a hole behind him and he was a prisr under the ice inside that hateful fence now a beaver must have air and there was no air there and no way of getting any up above on the ice an indian squatted he knew just what was happening down below and he grinned beside him lay the  beavers who had preceded tommy drowned now tommy was drowning his lungs felt as if they would burst dully he realized that this was the end as long as he could he held his breath and thentommy came to himself with a frightened jump he was sitting on the old wishingst and before him stretched the green meadows joyous with happy life he wasnt a beaver at all but he knew that he had been a beaver that he had lived the life of paddy the beaver he could remember every detail of it and he shuddered as he thought of those last dreadful minutes at the foodpile when he had felt himself drowning helplessly then the wonder of what he had learned grew upon him why he exclaimed a beaver is an engineer a lumberman a dredger a builder and a mason hes wonderful hes the most wonderful animal in all the world his face clouded why cant people leave him al he exploded a man that will trap and kill  of those little chaps is worse than a lynx or a wolf yes sir thats what he is those creatures kill to eat but man kills just for the few dollars paddys fur coat will bring when i grow up im going to do something to stop trapping and killing yes sir thats what im going to do tommy got up and stretched then he started for home and there was a thoughtful look on his freckled face gee he exclaimed ive learned a pile this time i didnt know there was so much pleasure in just work before i guess i wont complain any more over what i have to do iim mighty glad i was a beaver for a little while just for that and then whistling tommy headed straight for the woodpile and his ax he had work to do and he was glad of it   why tommy took up all his traps if there was  thing that tommy enjoyed above another it was trapping there were several reasons why he enjoyed it in the first place it took him out of doors with something definite to do he loved the meadows and the woods and the pastures and all the beauties of them with which old mother nature is so lavish he loved to tramp along the laughing brook and around the smiling pool always no matter what the time of the year there was something interesting to see now it was a flower new to him or a bird that he had not seen before again it was a fleeting glimpse of  of the shy fleetfooted little people who wear coats of fur he liked these best of all because they were the hardest to surprise and study in their home life and that was  reason why he enjoyed trapping so much it was matching his wits against their wits and  other reason was the my which he got for the pelts so tommy was glad when the late fall came and it was time to set traps and every morning make his rounds to see what he had caught in the coldest part of the winter when the snow was deep and the ice was thick he stopped trapping but he began again with the beginning of spring when the laughing brook was once more set free and the smiling pool no longer locked in icy fetters it was then that the muskrats and the minks became most active and their fur coats were still at their best you see the more active they were the more likely they were to step into  of his traps on this particular afternoon after school tommy had come down to the smiling pool to set a few extra traps for muskrats the trapping season that is the season when the fur was still at its best or prime as the fur dealers call it would soon be at an end he had set a trap on an old log which lay partly in and partly out of the water he knew that the muskrats used this old log to sun themselves because  had plunged off it as he came up so he set a trap just under water on the end of the old log where the first muskrat who tried to climb out there would step in it ill get  here as sure as shooting said tommy then he found a little grassy tussock and he knew by the matteddown grass that it was a favorite resting place for muskrats here he set another trap and left some slices of carrot as bait by the merest accident he found a hole in the bank and from the look of it he felt sure that it had been made by  of the furry little animals he wanted to catch right at the very entrance he set another trap and artfully covered it with watersoaked leaves from the bottom of the smiling pool so that it could not be seen id like to see anything go in or out of that hole without getting caught said he with an air of being mightily tickled with himself and his own smartness so he went on until he had set all his traps and all the time he was very happy spring had come and it is everybodys right to be happy in the spring he heard the joyous notes of the first birds who had come on the lagging heels of winter from the warm southland and they made him want to sing himself everything about him proclaimed new life and the joy of living he could feel it in the very air it was good to be alive after the last trap had been put in place he sat down on an old log to rest for a few minutes and enjoy the scene the smiling pool was as smooth as polished glass presently as tommy sat there without moving  little silver lines which met and formed a v started on the farther side of the smiling pool and came straight toward him tommy knew what those silver lines were they were the wake made by a swimming muskrat my i wish id brought my gun thought tommy its queer how a fellow always sees things when he hasnt a gun and never sees them when he has he could perceive the little brown head very plainly now and as it drew nearer he could distinguish the outline of the body just under the surface and back of that the queer rubbery flattened tail set edgewise in the water and moving rapidly from side to side its a regular propeller thought tommy and he certainly knows how to use it it sculls him right along if he should lose that he sure would be up against it tommy moved ever so little so as to get a better view instantly there was a sharp slap of the tail on the water a plunge and only a ripple to show that a second before there had been a swimmer there  other slaps and plunges sounded from distant parts of the smiling pool and tommy knew that he would see no more muskrats unless he sat very still for a long time slowly he got to his feet stretched and then started for home all the way across the green meadows he kept thinking of that little glimpse of muskrat life he had had and for the first time in his life he began to think that there might be something more interesting about a muskrat than his fur coat always before he had thought of a muskrat as simply a rat a big overgrown cousin of the pests that stole the grain in the henhouse and against whom every mans hand is turned as it should be but somehow that little glimpse of jerry muskrat at home had awakened a new interest it struck him quite suddenly that it was a very wonderful thing that an animal breathing air just as he did himself could be so at home in the water and disappear so suddenly and completely it must be fine to be able to swim like that thought tommy as he sat down on the wishingst and looked back across the green meadows to the smiling pool i wonder what he does down there under water now i think of it i dont know much about him except that he is the only rat with a fur that is good for anything if it wasnt for that fur coat of his i dont suppose anybody would bother him what a snap he would have then i guess he has no end of fun in the summer with nothing to worry about and plenty to eat and always cool and comfortable no matter what the weather what gets me is how he spends the winter when everything is frozen he must be under the ice for weeks i wonder if he sleeps the way the woodchuck does i suppose i can find out just by wishing seeing that im sitting right here on the old wishingst it would be a funny thing to do to wish myself into a rat it doesnt seem as if there could be anything very interesting about the life of anything so stupidlooking as a muskrat and yet ive thought the same thing about some other creatures and found i was wrong he gazed dreamily down toward the smiling pool and the longer he looked the more he wondered what it would be like to live there at last almost without knowing it he said the magic words ii wish i were a muskrat he murmured tommy was in the smiling pool he was little and furcoated with a funny little flattened tail and he really had  coats the outer of long hairs a sort of waterproof while the under coat was soft and fine and meant to keep him warm and though he was swimming with only his head out of water he wasnt wet at all it was a beautiful summer evening just at the hour of twilight and the smiling pool was very beautiful the most beautiful place that ever was at least it seemed so to tommy in the bulrushes a few little feathered folks were still twittering sleepily over on his big green lilypad grandfather frog was leading the frog chorus in a great deep voice from various places in the smiling pool came sharp little squeaks and faint splashes it was playtime for little muskrats and visiting time for big muskrats illustration it was playtime for the little muskrats an odor of musk filled the air and was very pleasant to tommy as he sniffed and sniffed he was playing hideandseek and tag with other little muskrats of his own age and not  of them had a care in all the world far away hooty the owl was sending forth his fierce hunting call but no  in the smiling pool took the least notice of it by and by it ceased tommy was chasing  of his playmates in and out among the bulrushes twice they had been warned by a wise old muskrat not to go beyond the line of bulrushes into the open water but little folks are forgetful especially when playing tommys little playmate forgot in the excitement of getting away from tommy he swam out where the first little star was reflected in the smiling pool a shadow passed over tommy and hardly had it passed when there was a sharp slap of something striking the water tommy knew what it was he knew that it was the tail of some watchful old muskrat who had discovered danger and that it meant dive at once tommy dived he didnt wait to learn what the danger was but promptly filled his little lungs with air plunged under water and swam as far as he could when he just had to come up for more air he put only his nose out and this in the darkest place he knew of among the rushes there he remained perfectly still down inside his heart was thumping with fear of he knew not what there wasnt a sound to be heard around the smiling pool it was as still as if there was no living thing there after what seemed like a long long time the deep voice of grandfather frog boomed out and then the squeak of the old muskrat who had given the alarm told all within hearing that all was safe again at once all fear left tommy and he swam to find his playmates what was it he asked  of them hooty the owl was the reply didnt you see him i saw a shadow replied tommy that was hooty i wonder if he caught anybody returned the other tommy didnt say anything but he thought of the playmate who forgot and swam out beyond the bulrushes and when he had hunted and hunted and couldnt find him he knew that hooty had not visited the smiling pool for nothing so tommy learned the great lesson of never being careless and forgetting later that same night as he sat on a little muddy platform on the edge of the water eating a delicious tender young lilyroot there came that same warning slap of a tail on the water tommy didnt wait for even  more nibble but plunged into the deepest water and hid as before this time when the signal that all was well was given he learned that some  with sharper ears than his had heard the footsteps of a fox on the shore and had given the warning just in the nick of time  things tommy learned that night first that safe and beautiful as it seems the smiling pool is not free from dangers for little muskrats second that forgetfulness means a short life third that to dive at the instant a dangersignal is sounded and inquire later what the danger was is the only sure way of being safe and th that it is the duty of every muskrat who detects danger to warn every other muskrat though he didnt realize it then this last was the most important lesson of all it was the great lesson that human beings have been so long learning and which many have not learned yet that just in proportion as each  looks out for the welfare of his neighbors he is himself better off instead of having just  pair of little eyes and  pair of keen little ears to guard him against danger tommy had many pairs of little eyes and little ears keeping guard all the time some of them better than his own eating sleeping and playing and of course watching out for danger were all that tommy had to think about through the long lazy summer and he grew and grew and grew until he was as big as the biggest muskrats in the smiling pool and could come and go as he pleased there was less to fear now from hooty the owl for hooty prefers tender young muskrats he had learned all about the ways of reddy fox and feared him not at all he had learned where the best lilyroots grow and how to find and open mussels those clams which live in fresh water he had a favorite old log half in the water to which he brought these to open them and eat them and more than  fight did he have before his neighbors learned to respect this as his he had explored all the shore of the smiling pool and knew every hole in the banks he had even been some distance up the laughing brook life was very joyous but as summer began to wane the days to grow shorter and the nights longer he discovered that playtime was over at least all his friends and neighbors seemed to think so for they were very very busy something inside told him that it was time high time that he also went to work cold weather was coming and he must be prepared for  thing he must have a comfortable home and the only way to get  was to make  for himself of course this meant work but somehow tommy felt that he would feel happier if he did work he was tired of doing nothing in particular in his roamings about he had seen many muskrat homes some of them old and deserted and some of them visited while the owners were away he knew just what a firstclass house should be like it should be high enough in the bank to be above water at all times even during the spring floods and it should be reached by a passage the entrance to which should at all times be under water even in the driest season on the bank of the smiling pool grew a tree and the spreading roots came down so that some of them were in the smiling pool itself under them tommy made the entrance to his burrow the roots hid it at first the digging was easy for the earth was little more than mud but as the passage slanted up the digging became harder still he kept at it  or  times he stopped and decided that he had g far enough then changed his mind and kept on at last he found a place to suit him and there he made a snug chamber not very far under the grassroots when he had finished it he was very proud of it he told jerry muskrat about it have you more than  entrance to it asked jerry no replied tommy it was hard enough work to make that  jerry turned up his nose that wouldnt do for me he declared a house with only  entrance is nothing but a trap supposing a fierce old mink should find that doorway while you were inside what would you do then tommy hadnt thought of that once more he went to work and made another long tunnel leading up to that snug chamber and then perhaps because he had got the habit he made a third from  of these tunnels he even made a short branch with a carefully hidden opening right out on the meadow for tommy liked to prowl around on land once in a while the chamber he lined with grass and old rushes until he had a very comfortable bed with all this hard work completed you would have supposed that tommy would have been satisfied wouldnt you but he wasnt he found that some of his neighbors were building houses of a wholly different kind and right away he decided that he must have  too so he chose a place where the water was shallow and not too far from the place where the waterlilies grew and there among the bulrushes he once more set to work this time he dug out the mud and the roots of the rushes piling them around him until he was in a sort of little well from this he dug several tunnels leading to the deep water where he could be sure that the entrance never would be frozen over the mud and sods he piled up until they came above the water and then he made a platform of rushes and mud with an opening in the middle down into that well from which his tunnels led on this platform he built a great mound of rushes and grass and even twigs all wattled together some of them he had to bring clear from the other side of the smiling pool and as he built that mound he made a nice large room in the middle biting off all the ends of sticks and rushes which happened to be in the way when he had made that room to suit him he made a comfortable bed there just as he had in the house in the bank then he built the walls very thick adding rushes and mud and sods all around except on the very top there he left the roof thinner with little spaces for the air to get in for of course he must have fresh air to breathe when at last the new house was finished he was very proud of it there were  rooms the upper  with its comfortable bed quite above the water and the lower  wholly under water connected with the former by a little doorway the only way of getting into the house was by  of his tunnels to the lower room when all was d an old muskrat looked it over and told him that he had d very well for a young fellow which made tommy feel very important the weather was growing cool now so tommy laid up some supplies in both houses and then spent his spare time calling on his neighbors by this time he had grown a fine thick coat and didnt mind at all how cold it grew in fact he liked the cold weather it was about this time that he had a dreadful experience he climbed out  evening on his favorite log to open and eat a mussel he had found there was a snap and something caught him by the tail and pinched dreadfully he pulled with all his might but the dreadful thing wouldnt let go he turned and bit at it but it was harder than his teeth and gnaw as he would he could make no impression on it a great terror filled his heart and he struggled and pulled heedless of the pain until he was too tired to struggle longer he just had to lie still after a while when he had regained his strength he struggled again this time he felt his tail give a little a neighbor swam over to see what all the fuss was about its a trap said he its lucky you are not caught by a foot instead of by the tail if you keep on pulling you may get free i did once this gave tommy new hope and he struggled harder than ever at last he fell headlong into the water the cruel steel jaws had not been able to keep his tapered tail from slipping between them he was free but oh so frightened after that tommy grew wise he never went ashore without first examining the place for  of those dreadful traps and he found more than  it got so that he gave up all his favorite places and made new s once he found  of his friends caught by a forefoot and he was actually cutting his foot off with his sharp teeth it was dreadful but it was the only way of saving his life those were sad and terrible times around the smiling pool and along the laughing brook for the people in fur but there didnt seem to be anything they could do about it except to everlastingly watch out  morning tommy awoke to find the smiling pool covered with ice he liked it a sense of great peace fell on the smiling pool there was no more danger from traps except around certain spring holes and there was no need of going there much of the time tommy slept in that fine house of rushes and mud its walls had frozen solid and it was as comfortable as could be imagined a couple of friends who had no house stayed with him when they were hungry all they had to do was to drop down into the tunnel leading to deep water and so out into the smiling pool under the ice dig up a lilyroot and swim back and eat it in comfort inside the house if they got short of air while swimming under the ice they were almost sure to find little air spaces under the edge of the banks no matter how bitter the cold or how wild the storm above the icebelow it was always calm and the temperature never changed sometimes tommy went over to his house in the bank once while he was there a bloodthirsty mink followed him tommy heard him coming and escaped down  of the other passages then he was thankful indeed that he had made more than  but this was his only adventure all the long winter at last spring came the ice disappeared and the water rose in the laughing brook until it was above the banks and in the smiling pool until tommys house was nearly under water then he moved over to his house in the bank and was comfortable again  day he swam over to his house of rushes and climbed up on the top he had no thought of danger there and he was heedless snap a trap set right on top of the house held him fast by  leg a mist swam before his eyes as he looked across the green meadows and heard the joyous carol of welcome robin why oh why should there be such misery in the midst of so much joy he was trying to make up his mind to lose his foot when far up on the edge of the meadows he saw an old gray rock somehow the sight of it brought a vague sense of comfort to him he strained his eyes to see it better andtommy was just himself rubbing his eyes as he sat on the old wishingst i was just going to cut my foot off ugh he shuddered  or  times ive found a foot in my traps but i never realized before what it really meant why those little chaps had more nerve than ill ever have he gazed thoughtfully down toward the smiling pool then suddenly he sprang to his feet and began to run toward it its too late to take all of em up tonight he muttered but ill take what i can and tomorrow morning ill take up the rest i hope nothing will get caught in em i never knew before how dreadful it must be to be caught in a trap ill never set another trap as long as i live so there why jerry muskrat is almost as wonderful as paddy the beaver and he doesnt do anything a bit of harm i didnt know he was so interesting he hasnt as many troubles as some but he has enough i guess without me adding to them say thats a great life he leads if it wasnt for traps it wouldnt be half bad to be a muskrat of course its better to be a boy but i can tell you right now im going to be a better boyless thoughtless and cruel jerry muskrat you havent anything more to fear from me not a thing i take off my hat to you for a busy little worker and for having more nerve than any boy i know and never again did tommy set a trap for little wild folk   tommy learns what it is like to be a bear tommys thoughts were straying somehow they were straying most of the time these days they had been ever since that day when he had wished himself into a beaver he dreamed of the great woods where rivers have their beginnings in gurgling brooks and great lakes reflect mossgray giants of the forest where the beavers still ply their many trades unharmed by man the deer follow paths of their own making the otters make merry on their slipperyslides the lynx pass through the dark shadows themselves but grayer shadows and bears go fishing gather berries and hunt the stored sweets of the bees in short the spell of the great woods the wilderness unmarred by the hand of man was upon tommy eagerly he read all that he could find about the feathered and furred folk who dwell there and the longing to know more about them and their ways to learn these things for himself grew and grew he wanted to hear things with his own ears and see things with his own eyes sometimes he went over to the green forest near his home and played that it was the great woods and that he was a mighty hunter then happy jack the gray squirrel became a fierceeyed tuftedeared bobtailed lynx saucy chatterer the red squirrel became a crafty fisher the footprints of reddy fox grew in size to those of a wolf peter rabbit was transformed into his cousin of the north jumper the hare and a certain old black stump was buster bear but it was only once in a while that tommy played the hunter somehow since he had learned so many things about the lives of the little feathered and furred people about him he cared less and less about hunting them so most often when the green forest became the great woods he was buster bear that was more fun than being a hunter much more fun there was only  drawbackhe didnt know as much about buster bear and his ways as he wished he did so now as he trudged along towards the pasture to drive home the cows for the evening milking his thoughts were straying to the great woods and buster bear as he came to the old wishingst he glanced up at the sun there was no need to hurry he would have plenty of time to sit down there a while so down he sat on the big gray rock and his thoughts went straying straying deep into the great woods far from cows and milking and the woodpile just beyond the kitchen door bears never had to chop wood i wish said tommy dreamily that i were a bear that was all just a little spoken wish but tommy was no longer a dreamy boy with evening chores yet to be d he was a little black furry animal not unlike an overgrown puppy following at the heels of a great gaunt black bear in short tommy was a bear himself all about him was the beautiful wilderness the great woods of his boyish dreams just behind him was another little bear his twin sister and the big bear was their mother presently they came to an opening where there were no trees but a tangle of brush years before fire had swept through there though tommy knew nothing about that in fact tommy knew little about anything as yet save that it was good oh so good to be alive on the edge of this opening mother bear paused and sat up on her haunches while she sniffed the air the  little bears did the same thing they didnt know why but they did it because mother bear did then she dropped to all s and told them to remain right where they were until she called them they watched her disappear in the brush and waited impatiently it seemed to them a very long time before they heard her call and saw her head above the bushes as she sat up but really it was only a few minutes then they scampered to join her each trying to be first when they reached her such a glad sight as greeted them all about were little bushes loaded with berries that seemed to have stolen their color from the sky they were blueberries with funny little squeals and grunts they stripped the berries from the bushes and ate and ate until they could eat no more then they wrestled with each other and stood up on their hind legs and boxed until they were out of breath and glad to lie down for a rest while mother bear continued to stuff herself with berries it was very beautiful there in the great woods and the  little bears just bubbled over with high spirits they played hideandseek behind stumps and trees they played tag they chased each other up tall trees  would climb to the top of a tall stump and the other would follow and try to knock the first  off sometimes both would tumble down and land with a thump that would knock the breath from their little bodies the bumps would hurt sometimes and make them squeal this would bring mother bear in a hurry to see what had happened and when she would find that no harm had come to them she would growl a warning and sometimes spank them for giving her a fright but best of all they loved to wrestle and box and though they didnt know it they were learning something they were learning to be quick in their movements they were learning how to strike swiftly and how to dodge quite as swiftly once in a while they would stand and not try to dodge but see who could stand the hardest blow and once in a while i am sorry to say they quarreled and fought then mother bear would take a hand and cuff and spank them until they squalled very early they learned that mother bear was to be minded once she sent them up a tree and told them to stay there until she returned then she went off to investigate something which interested her when she returned the  little cubs were nowhere to be seen they had grown tired of waiting for her to return and had come down to do a little investigating of their own it didnt take her long to find them oh my no and when she didwell all the neighbors knew that  little cubs had disobeyed and  little cubs were sure very sure that they never would do so again tommy was  at first during those lovely summer days mother bear never went far from them you see when they were very small there were dangers oh yes there are dangers even for little bears tufty the lynx would have liked nothing better than a meal of tender young bear and howler the wolf would have rejoiced in an opportunity to snatch  of them without the risk of an encounter with mother bear but tommy and his sister grew fast very fast you see there were so many good things to eat their mother dug for them the most delicious roots tearing them from the ground with her great claws it wasnt long before they had learned to find them for themselves and to dig them where the earth was soft enough then there were berries raspberries and blackberries and blueberries all they wanted to be had for the gathering and by way of variety there were occasional fish tommy as a boy was very fond of fishing as a bear he was quite as fond of it on his first fishingtrip he got a wetting a spanking and no fish it happened this way mother bear had led them  moonlight night to a brook they never had visited before up the brook she led them until they reached a place where it was broad and shallow the water gurgling and rippling over the sts and singing merrily they were left in the brush on the edge of the brook where they could see and were warned to keep still and watch then mother bear statid herself at a point where the water was just a wee bit deeper than elsewhere and ran a wee bit faster for it had cut a little channel there for a long time she sat motionless a big black spot in the moonlight which might have been a stump to eyes which had not seen her go there tommy wondered what it all meant for a long time at least it was a long time to tommy nothing happened the brook gurgled and sang and mother bear sat as still as the very rocks tommy began to get impatient he was bubbling over with high spirits and sitting still was hard very hard little by little he stole nearer to the water until he was on very edge right behind mother bear then he caught a splash down the brook he looked in that direction but could see nothing then there was another splash he saw a silvery line and then made out a moving form there was something alive coming up the brook he edged over a little farther to see better there it was coming nearer and nearer though he didnt know it then it was a big trout working its way up the brook to the springholes higher up where the water was deep and cold in the shallowest places the fish was sometimes half out of water it was making straight for the little channel where mother bear sat nearer it came suddenly mother bear moved like lightning  of her big paws struck down and under scooping the trout out and sending it flying towards the shore alas for tommy he was directly in the way the fish hit him full in the face fell back in the water wriggled and jumped franticallyand was g tommy was so startled that he gave a frightened little whimper and then a big black paw descended and sent him rolling over and over in the water squalling lustily wet frightened and miserable tommy scrambled to his feet and bolted for the shore where he hid in the brush i didnt mean to he kept whimpering as he watched mother bear return to her fishing presently another trout came along and was sent flying up on the shore then tommy watched his obedient sister enjoy a feast while he got not so much as a taste after that they often went fishing on moonlight nights tommy had learned his lesson and knew that fish were the reward of patience and it was not long before he was permitted to fish for himself sometimes they went frogging along the marshy shores of a little pond this was even more fun than fishing it was great sport to locate a big frog by the sound of his deep bass voice and then softly steal up and cut a chugarum short right in the middle then when he had eaten his fill it was just as much fun to keep on hunting them just to see them plunge with long frightened leaps into the water it tickled tommy immensely and he would hunt them by the hour just for this  day mother bear led them to an old dead tree half rotted away at the bottom while they sat and looked on in roundeyed wonder she tore at the rotten wood with her great claws almost at once the air about her was full of insects humming angrily tommy drew nearer a sharp pain on the end of his nose made him jump and squeal another shooting pain in  ear brought another squeal and he slapped at the side of his head  of those humming insects dropped at his feet it must be that it had had something to do with that pain illustration another shooting pain in  ear brought another squeal tommy beat a retreat into the brush but mother bear kept on clawing at the tree growling and whining and stopping now and then to slap at the insects about her by and by the tree fell with a crash it partly split when it struck the ground then mother bear put her great claws into the crack and tore the tree open for you know she was very strong tommy caught a whiff of something that made his mouth water never in all his short life had he smelled anything so delicious he forgot all about the pain in his nose and his ear and came out of his hidingplace mother bear thrust a great paw into the tree and tore out a piece of something yellow and dripping and tossed it in tommys direction there were a lot of those insects crawling over it but tommy didnt mind the smell of it told him that it must be the best thing that ever was better than berries or fish or frogs or roots and with the first taste he knew that his nose had told the truth it was hy it didnt take tommy a minute to gobble up hy comb bees and all then heedless of stings he joined mother bear what were a few stings compared to such delicious sweets so he learned that hollow trees are sometimes of interest to bears they ate and ate until tommys little stomach was swelled out like a little balloon then they rolled on the ground to crush the bees clinging to their fur after which mother bear led them to a muddy place on the shore of a little pond and the cool mud took out the fire of the stings later tommy learned that not all beetrees could be pulled down in this way but that sometimes they must be climbed and ripped open with the claws of  paw while he held on with the other and endured the stings of the bees as best he could but the hy was always worth all it cost to get next to feasting on hy tommy enjoyed most a meal of ants particularly red ants and this seems queer because red ants are as sour as hy is sweet but it was so any kind of ants were easier to find and to get than hy the latter he had only once in a while but ants he had every day he found them thousands of them under and in rotting old logs and in decayed old stumps he seldom passed an old log without trying to roll it over if he succeeded he was almost sure to find a frightened colony of ants rushing about frantically a few sweeps of his long tongue a smacking of his lips and he moved on sometimes he found grubs of fat beetles and these though not so good as the ants were always acceptable on his bill of fare and he dearly loved to hunt woodmice it was almost as much fun as fishing or frogging so the long summer passed happily and tommy grew so fast that presently he became aware that not even tufty the lynx willingly crossed his path he could go and come unafraid of any of the wilderness dwellers and forgot what fear was until a neverforgotten day in the early fall he had followed mother bear to a certain place where late blueberries still clung to the bushes as she reached the edge of the opening she stopped short and lifted her nose wrinkling the skin of it as she tested the air tommy did the same he had great faith in what his nose could tell him the wind brought to him now a strange smell unlike any he had known an unpleasant smell somehow he didnt know why it gave him a queer prickly feeling all over he looked at mother bear she was staring out into the blueberry patch and her lips were drawn back in an ugly way showing her great teeth tommy looked out in the berrypatch there were  strange legged creatures gathering berries they were not nearly as big as mother bear and they didnt look dangerous he stared at them curiously then he turned to look at mother bear she was stealing away so silently that not even a leaf rustled she was afraid tommy followed her taking care not to make the least sound when they were at a safe distance he asked what it meant those were men growled mother bear deep down in her throat and that was the mansmell whenever you smell that steal away men are the only creatures you have to fear but whatever you do keep away from them they are dangerous after that tommy continually tested the air for the dreaded mansmell several times he caught it once from a safe hidingplace he watched a fisherman and another time a party of campers but he took care that they should not suspect that he was near by late fall he was so big that he began to feel independent and to wander off by himself almost every day he would stand up to a tree reach as far up as he could and dig his claws into the bark to see how tall he was with the falling of the beechnuts tommy found a new and delicious food and stuffed himself these days he roamed far and wide and explored all the country for miles around he grew fat and as the weather grew colder his coat grew thicker he learned much about his neighbors and their ways and his sense of humor led him often to give them scares just for the fun of seeing them jump and run with the coming of the first snow a strange desire to sleep stole over him he found a great tree which had been torn up by the roots in some wind storm and about which smaller trees had fallen making a great tangle under the upturned roots of the great tree was a hollow and into this he scraped leaves and the branches of young balsams which he broke off thus he made a comfortable bed and with a sigh of contentment lay down to sleep the snow fell and drifted over his bedroom but he knew nothing of that the cold winds the bitter winds swept through the wilderness and the trees cracked with the cold but tommy slept on days slipped into weeks and weeks into months and still he slept he would not waken until gentle spring melted the snow unless moooo tommys eyes flew wide open for a full minute he stared blinkeringly out over the green meadows then with a jump he came to his feet my gracious its getting late and those cows are wondering what has become of me he exclaimed he hurried toward the pasture breaking into a run for it was milkingtime but his thoughts were far away they were in the great woods ive been a bear he exclaimed triumphantly and i know just how he lives and feels and why he loves the great woods so of all the creatures ive been since i found out about the old wishingst id rather be buster bear than any  next to being just what i am he has more fun than any  i know of and nothing and nobody to fear but man tommys brow clouded for an instant its a shame he blurted out that every living thing is afraid of man andand i guess its his own fault they neednt ever be afraid of me i can tell them that that old wishingst has taught me a lot and i am never going to forget how it feels to be hunted and afraid all the time and tommy never has \n"
